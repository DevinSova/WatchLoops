Outside of curse it's a good way to end an air combo if you can't confirm into a curse building combo in time as it gives emergency tech knockdown for oki. It's technically a quite large overhead, though it's seldom seen used as one.\nThere is a high, medium, and low arc possible when doing this move.

Slowly homes in on the opponent before attaching to their character on contact. Once attached all horizontal movement from the opponent is reduced to roughly 1/3rd of normal horizontal distance and travel speed. You can still jump and use any vertical components of special movements normally while slowed (such as Mai's 214 command backjump or Rachel's Wind), but any horizontal movement in such a move will be fully affected.\nHorizontal movement includes things like runs, walks, air dashes, Jin's Ice Car, Bullet's Drive attacks, Mai's 236 command dash, Nu's Act Parser, Izayoi's B and C version Mirage Thruster, and even teleport dashes such as Azrael's and Arakune's himself. It mostly does not affect moves that teleport with a set position in mind rather than a direction of travel, such as Bang's four seal Distortion Drive, Izayoi's D version Mirage Thruster teleport, or Arakune's screen wrap. (With the somewhat odd exception of Kokonoe's Graviton teleport, which barely moves her at all when slowed)\nIt is in your best interest as Arakune to end every combo leading up to curse with slow cloud so it becomes impossible for them to run from your incoming mixups, forcing them to challenge your blockstrings directly (very dangerous). It also makes rolling on knockdown as unsafe as quick teching for the opponent, as they won't roll far enough to actually escape from bugs, guaranteeing you can focus on committing to a mixup versus a neutral tech. If for any reason the opponent becomes cursed where you cannot immediately spit a slow cloud onto them, this is generally still the first thing you want to do to ensure the time spent chasing them down is minimized."

Slowly homes in on the opponent before attaching to their character on contact. Once attached all horizontal movement from the opponent is reduced to roughly 1/3rd of normal horizontal distance and travel speed. You can still jump and use any vertical components of special movements normally while slowed (such as Mai's 214 command backjump or Rachel's Wind), but any horizontal movement in such a move will be fully affected.\nHorizontal movement includes things like runs, walks, air dashes, Jin's Ice Car, Bullet's Drive attacks, Mai's 236 command dash, Nu's Act Parser, Izayoi's B and C version Mirage Thruster, and even teleport dashes such as Azrael's and Arakune's himself. It mostly does not affect moves that teleport with a set position in mind rather than a direction of travel, such as Bang's four seal Distortion Drive, Izayoi's D version Mirage Thruster teleport, or Arakune's screen wrap. (With the somewhat odd exception of Kokonoe's Graviton teleport, which barely moves her at all when slowed)\nIt is in your best interest as Arakune to end every combo leading up to curse with slow cloud so it becomes impossible for them to run from your incoming mixups, forcing them to challenge your blockstrings directly (very dangerous). It also makes rolling on knockdown as unsafe as quick teching for the opponent, as they won't roll far enough to actually escape from bugs, guaranteeing you can focus on committing to a mixup versus a neutral tech. If for any reason the opponent becomes cursed where you cannot immediately spit a slow cloud onto them, this is generally still the first thing you want to do to ensure the time spent chasing them down is minimized.",

No matter how close to teching the opponent is the cocoon will always finish reaching the top of the screen before they are allowed to airtech. They will always be able to tech once it reaches the top, even on a Fatal Counter, so tag a curse building spider on the end of it if you can't follow up with a proper combo before they reach the apex of the stage.

                        "Description": "Invul 1-16 All\nNote: Not a low anymore\nHitting Arakune while active will cancel the bees\nArakune summons a massive swarm of bees from the ground, stinging and cursing anything and anyone on their way up off the top of the screen. The amount of hits this move does is somewhat variable, but it hits the most (24 hits) right in the very center of the move. Further towards the edges the opponent will be hit by less and less bees, often in multiples of 4, down to a typical range of 12-16 hits. Each hit gives 500F curse meter, so while it's rare to see someone be hit for less than 12 hits, it is not impossible to get caught in F of G and escape uncursed. On block the bees do significantly less, typically 1/3rd curse meter in the very center and a little less than 1/4th around the edges. \nIn neutral this super is a very poor choice, as 35 frames after superflash is plenty of time for your opponent to dash out of the super's radius and punish you for the attempt. Instead, this super is best used as a fullscreen 100% curse punish and way to start pressure. Catch a Tsubaki charging stocks or a Mai winding up a spear at fullscreen? Curse them for it from a range they thought was safe. If they block it, they still take a sizeable amount of curse and let you close the gap for some pressure. Additionally this super shines as a re-curse option. Pop this in corner after your curse combo ends and the opponent will have to start their new lease on life at a sizeable curse meter deficit right off the bat. Do it right with a cloud on the field or catch them trying to mash something and you might just get a free re-curse for your trouble.\nIn Overdrive this Distortion changes very little, gaining only 4 extra hits (and so barely any difference in curse potential). However the edges of the move in overdrive seem to have more generous hitboxes, leading to it being more common to be hit for a 16+ hit combo even at the very edge of its range.",

When summoned the curse gauge turns from its usual red hue to a royal purple as an indicator that the moth is active. Hitting Arakune will stop the bug from starting another pass until the combo ends, but won't stop it from finishing the bombing run it's already on, making the usual tactic of \"DP Arakune to stop the bugs\" largely useless against F equals. This lets you get away with increasingly unsafe mixups and approaches as long as the bug can cover you after the retaliation should the attempt fail. You can summon two Mothras if you are crazy enough to invest the heat.\nAs good as that sounds though, realistically this super is rarely used. It's hard to justify the 50 meter and time in curse spent summoning the super over just starting a regular curse mixup, as in most cases combos involving the F equals moth do about the same or less overall damage than a standard curse combo while taking substantially more curse time to finish. You also often can't complete your standard combos while the moth is active as it will break up D Bug's launch if timed inopportunely. In theory you can use the super to get more windows for resets, but that's also more opportunities to fail. Generally, just being in curse normally with 50 unspent heat is more efficient use of your curse time.\nIt's not all bad news though. For being what this super is it's unquestionably Fun\u2122 to use, and an amazing way to swag on your opponent. And in situations where you don't need a full combo to kill, this super is pound for pound your best way to spend 50 heat in order to get more chances to connect with your opponent while in curse. Pop overdrive if you have it to start the super with even the smallest windows of curse and have Mothra cover both your approach and your retreat should you fail.\nIn Overdrive Mothra loses the 8 hit cap per pass and becomes capable of multihitting as many times as the opponent is still in the hitbox. Usually this means 10-11, but in ideal scenarios it can be pushed to 15+. Additonally by simply Overdriving you give yourself more time in curse, meaning the super stays active longer. Without Overdrive you can expect 3-4 passes from F equals when called early. With it you can get up to 6.\nWhile not overwhelming in most circumstances, this super is probably the part of BBCF Arakune's game that has been explored the least. So its usefulness is also the most subject to change in the future. Outside of that though you're usually better off saving your heat for something else."

On hit, he then swallows and chomps down on the opponent before spitting them back out on the opposite side they started on. Puts Arakune in Active Flow if he hasn't already been in it that round. Has full invul and is safe on block, but it has no minimum damage and cannot be rapid-canceled. You won't be using this often on offense as almost none of your curse combos benefit from ending with it. On defense the sideswap can be very convenient for turning a horrible situation into corner pressure, however simply summoning bugs to defend yourself after a defensive OD is usually superior.

After your opponent recovers from any hitstun during this time (Including the combo from Scud Punishment itself), both weakpoints will be reapplied for 1000F.\nUnlike other drive moves, the presence of weakpoints on the opponent before this moves hits does not change any of this move's damage, hitstun or other properties.\nAn interesting move that trades damage up front for the chance to get much more damage later by ensuring both weakpoints are available for any combo you are able to start. Not recommended to be used as a reversal in most cases due to its poor recovery and that Panzer strike is a much safer option if you already have 50 Heat to make it safe, however it is still possible to get a decently damaging, if short, combo if you score a counterhit. Can be very useful when combined with Black Hawk Stinger due to it being unblockable when both weakpoints are active. It's somewhat unnecessary to stack this with Overdrive due to their similar effects and you gain little extra damage when this is used, so keep that in mind when choosing when to use this.",

While it is mainly used after 6C due to it being the easiest place to chain into j.D, if done early enough, j.D can be combo'd into from j.C, allowing Bang to convert from even the weirdest angles in the air.\nWhile the move isn't used that much in neutral, it is a decent wakeup tool to kill opponents meaty throws and gain at least 2 seals minimum from the confirm, as well as hitting overhead.  A peculiar principle of j.D is that the normal forces you into landing recovery if you cancel from it with a special or a jump if used high enough from the ground, even if you use something with noticeably less recovery, j.D's landing recovery will override it, forcing you into around a 20-ish frame cooldown unless you Rapid Cancel.",

The explosion itself is extremely active, causing it to catch opponents late into its active frames as Bang is recovering or clashing with many different projectiles, outright nullifying them in most cases.  Not only that, the explosion itself fatals, meaning Bang can securely followup with a punishing combo that can set up for oki, but you can't get too crazy due to the explosion itself being a short starter.\nBang is unable to cancel out of his recovery in 2.0, but his recovery time is significantly shortened due to not being launched as high, so bang is still effectively plus when the explosion is blocked, giving him a cover in order to do a mixup scenario or give him much better followup options due to the new recovery.  Also, they changed the blockstun of drive explosion to only do 1 hit of blockstun, but that doesn't mean they nerfed the active frames at all, so it can still catch people off guard if they try to rush in.  While it can be punished in very specific scenarios, the general usefulness, amazing hitbox and active frames, and the fact that it is safe on block means that drive explosion is a pretty good option to use.",

It could also be tked from a jump cancelable move to add another layer of mix up options like overheads with j.B, cross up if you let the float last longer and reset your mix-up options if you use D nails.\nIt is used during combos due to its ability to keep Bang on the same height which opens up new combo path with either 6C or j.C.\nIt should be noted that during OD, FRKZ dashes can't be canceled from float. You need to press either A, B or C to dash after a float.\nIn 2.0, the minimum height restriction for J22A has been completely removed, allowing Bang to TK J22A at much lower heights, effectively giving him access to better pressure options, better confirms, just generally much better over all.  This buff is arguably his greatest buff, seeing as it opens up a plethora of options for him now.",

Always check your Fu and Rin seals during overdrive activation so you know what you have to work with.\nUsing the dashes during pressure allows Bang to easily create extremely hard to block mixups, the key is to be creative with your approaches like doing 2B>9dash>j.2C>4dash>j.2C. Keep in mind that strings like these are vulnerable to reversals.\nWhile the dash is powerful it's also is hard to control, so try not to get into neutral during overdrive, since opponents will mostly get high in the air and press a lot of buttons making it really hard for you to get in without getting hit and even if you somehow manage to hit them it's really hard to confirm into a proper combo.\nWhen you have the 6D(Rin) seal overdrive can be used to beat out several strings from characters that use projectiles to pressure you.\nAlso, a weird property for FRKZ dashes that used to be in CPEX was that you can cancel the dash into a neutral normal.  This is no longer available in CF, so bang is forced to go through the entire dash animation if you wanna do something like 6Dash > 5A.  However, bang can still cancel his dashes into directional normals like 6A or 3C.",

Active Flow version makes Bang throw out even more stuff, including 4 bombs at the end instead of 2.  Puts Bang in active flow if he hasn't been in it already. Has full invuln and is safe on block, but it cannot be rapid cancelled on hit/block.  Has minimum damage in 2.0 now.\nDespite being another universal reversal that Bang can use, the knockdown from the attack leaves much to be desired.  It leaves him slightly negative and a character length away, which means the opponent can roll away from him before he can perform actions again, leaving him with almost no oki from it.  However, in the corner, it is slightly more useful seeing as the opponent can only roll forward or tech instantly otherwise they would be picked up with a perfectly spaced 2B into a damaging corner combo.  Despite some of its shortcomings, Exceed Accel is one of Bangs most reliable ways to get out of pressure, seeing as even if it whiffs, he still has a third of his burst charged up rather than none if he just bursts.",

It was always a thing, apparently.\nExtremly satisfying Astral. Can be combo'd into from 5D airborne hit in the corner or throws reliably. However, the True Bang Way is landing this astral raw either as a wakeup reversal or tricking your opponent to press a button into it.  It has a guardpoint all the way until the end of the active frames, so it can be used to stop attacks or just be a GOD!\nImpresses people at your locals and gatherings and makes you look like a Hero fighting against ANY EVIL!!",

Because of the importance of building Heat Up, going from 6C > j.D directly is advised for consistency though it does make confirming into j.D harder.\nIt can be used as a way to continue pressure by jump canceling it, but 6C itself uses one of Bullet's available jumps so her options after it are limited and wary opponents will watch out for them. Though jump canceling 6C on block removes the risk of the move, as Bullet moves forward during its duration, the jump cancel timing can vary depending on when it actually connects to the opponent. \nOne safe, generally effective option out of 6C is to do jump back j.D, as if 6C hits j.D will combo as the opponent is knocked closer into the air, while if 6C is blocked, j.D will not reach the opponent as the lack of knock up leaves them too far away.",

As a result, you won't always be using Cutting Shear as an Ender.\nWary opponents may stand a step outside 623B's range and wait for her to whiff it, so be very mindful of its usage against players comfortable with Bullet. As Bullet stays locked in place and it can be hard for 623B to connect just to have a chance to rapid cancel it, it is a fairly easy reversal to bait and punish.

You can make first overhead hit whiff, allowing only the low to hit instead, though hitting only the low doesn't let you combo without Rapid or counter hit. With meter, 6A(1) > RC > into either j.B or IAD > j.B represents a good overhead starter for a mixup that's easy to confirm and leads to good damage. On a midscreen counter hit, the opponent isn't pushed as far away, allowing you to combo reliably.",

For similar reasons, 3C can also be a good button to poke someone out of trying to dash back in and reset their pressure with buttons. 3C has a pretty good amount of recovery on whiff though and is risky so you don't want to use 3C to poke too often .",

Beating this move is a little different to other reversals since the two-stage nature of the move will beat out a lot of backdashes. However it takes longer to perform and is only invulnerable for the first strike, so if it does miss or get blocked, your opponent has a long time to react with their best punish.\nThe enchanted version of Griflet has a third strike that knocks the opponent downwards and ground bounces.

This is the key defensive tool in most match-ups and a life changer when you get 4 magatamas as your opponent has to play around it unless they want to lose the momentum. Since you can special cancel the attack's recovery and Hakumen is left relatively close to the opponent after a successful catch, a common way to convert into a longer combo is to use Kishuu (623A) into 5C afterwards.\nSpecial note should be taken about the OD version: unlike most other Distortion Drives, this pauses the OD timer for about the entire duration of the move. Combine this with the version's lengthy animation, a removed meter cooldown and the fact that the accelerated meter gain of OD isn't paused, and this means that, by the time the move ends, you'll have regained pretty much all of the magatama spent for this move upon a successful catch. This can lead to even more damaging combos that can end in EA.",

Another thing of note is that if performed in a combo with a Fatal Counter starter and sufficient meter, you can link the overdrive version into the normal version for extra damage or style.\nHidden Phoenix can also sometimes be a good option for beating projectiles at closer ranges because of its invul and range, though mainly in oki situations rather than neutral ones.

Crush trigger moves are blocked like any other, they do not consume additional barrier when they are blocked.\nPart of what makes Izanami so damn scary.  Can be used in order to take control of the match if you find yourself pushed against the wall and also just forces your opponent to try to block or evade you during this time. It also gives you a way to block while you're in active mode, mitigating some of the risk, particularly to guard cancel Exceed Accels. While it isn't completely invulnerable, opponents trying to grab you in this time are easy to prevent since they have no other options to mix it up with, and can be mitigated by using a low hover or moves like 6B.\nWhile active, you must consider how you wish to dispel Shield of Dreams before it forces danger state. This is accomplished by using Distant affection, Stake of Supremacy or Bulwark, each of which carries their own risk. If you do get danger state, remember that you can use overdrive to prematurely end it as long as you've recovered at least some barrier.",

If you do manage to hit with it you'll preserve your remaining barrier without needing to risk using bulwark. Like other command throws, this can be baited in similar ways and has an awful recovery if you miss.

Throw in normal mode yields lower reward and a weaker knockdown than standard conversions, but in Gain Art, allows you to really outshine other S starter confirms.

On hit, has an enormous amount of untechable time, usually leading into some kind of workable knockdown. More advantageous the higher you do it from; can almost always link into 5A, 5C, or Justice Phorizer for a combo extension, or 6A or 5B from higher knockdowns.",

They may also jump cancel, but the follow up attack must be barrier blocked and may still catch them.\n50% P1 and Very Short starter makes this move lead to mediocre damage.\nSimilar to Hakumen's drive moves but with a much more limited set of moves it can actually catch. Use it to call out people autopiloting pokes and pressure strings. Definitely not a move to throw out randomly due to its short active time and the sheer number of moves that just go around it.\nThough the follow up attack itself is +1 on block, you can still cancel to specials on block. Notably 632146C will be a frame trap for FCH to catch people who do not know you are safe and trying to 5A you, and it is also the most reliable combo starter. If the follow up attack happened to be instant blocked they would need a 6F 5A to trade, and the hit state on this attack will allow you to recover sooner. You can also hold it for a sneaky unblockable too if they do not mash.

Catches moves that aren't throws, lows, overheads or projectiles.\nOn successful catch, follows up with an elbow smash that can be blocked. Crumples on grounded enemies, wall bounces airborne opponents.\nIf the follow up attack hits the opponent, Jubei instantly builds 22 Heat meter on normal hit, 24 on counter hit.\nSince this parry is Guard Point, opponents may still Rapid Cancel to block the follow up attack. They may also jump cancel, but the follow up attack must be barrier blocked and may still catch them.\n50% P1 and Very Short starter makes this move lead to mediocre damage.\nSimilar to Hakumen's drive moves but with a much more limited set of moves it can actually catch. Use it to call out people autopiloting pokes and pressure strings. Definitely not a move to throw out randomly due to its short active time and the sheer number of moves that just go around it.\nThough the follow up attack itself is +1 on block, you can still cancel to specials on block. Notably 632146C will be a frame trap for FCH to catch people who do not know you are safe and trying to 5A you, and it is also the most reliable combo starter. If the follow up attack happened to be instant blocked they would need a 6F 5A to trade, and the hit state on this attack will allow you to recover sooner. You can also hold it for a sneaky unblockable too if they do not mash. Special cancelling to 236B is a true block string into a low attack, that can also be converted into a combo off 6A if you have 50 heat to spend on 360A or a Rapid Cancel of your own.",

On grounded opponents, comboing off of it when done around the peak of Jubei's jump is finnicky as it does not have very much hitstun and, if not done close, Jubei lacks moves with fast enough startup and range to confirm into.\nWhile not the best for confirms, its speed matches j.B's and it has even more horizontal reach than j.C while also having a decent downwards hitbox, making it Jubei's best air poke in terms of range. However, as it cannot be jump-canceled on block and it is difficult to confirm off of higher in the air, it can be hard to do more than simply poke with it.\nA good analogue to this move would be Hibiki's j.C as their function and hitbox is very similar. The biggest difference between the two however is in their active frames (3 versus 6). As a result of this and other differences, Hibiki's j.C is a strong general use tool while Jubei's j.2C is more of a situationally useful crossup and air poke due to its relatively fast startup and range.",

Each version lays down 4 waypoints on screen in a specific order and Jubei does a teleport dash attack between each one. If these hit his opponent, they will be sent flying in the same direction of the attack, causing each of the 4 attacks to combo together in most cases. To use, press D and then immediately press the specified direction and button to use the listed attack pattern. Hold up/down when selecting a path and the path will angle in that direction\nGrounded versions of this drive behave the same as the air versions except that ground versions can only be angled upwards.\nNot pressing any button will result in Jubei using the standard 5D version instead.\nAny hit from any version inflicts the Shiranui Mark.\nUnless Jubei is in overdrive, he must touch the ground before being able to use his drive again.\nIf a waypoint laid by this move ends up off the sides of the screen, it will be placed at the edge of the screen at the same height it would normally be. Similarly if a waypoint would be placed under the floor, it is instead placed at ground level at the same horizontal position it would normally be.\nIn terms of actual usage, these drive moves see use inside combos to give good damage while affording a certain amount of control over where your opponent ends up, generally the D versions gets used the most for consistency. It's also one way to gain additional height in your air combo to maximise how much damage your distortion drive will do.\nOutside of combos, the more fiddly A and B patterns are used to form a crossup, since both patterns look very similar but with their middle two waypoints swapped. A keen eyed opponent can see the order the waypoints appears and react accordingly, however.",

This attack wall bounces in the corner for easy conversions, but is highly punishable on block and cannot be followed up further.\nAir version startup is comparable to jump normals and in some cases is your best air to air attack.\nJubei slashes forward rapidly, using anywhere from 1 to 4 small grounded swipes and, if he chooses, a 5th large swipe that he jumps into. During install, Fissuring Slash (\"Rekk\u014dzan\") now grants Jubei great freedom compared to how it is before you activate Jubei's install. As Jubei can now vary the amount of Additional Attack slashes that occur during Fissuring Slash, choose between multiple followups that can create mix ups, or cancel to his command air dashes even while grounded to create space or do low to the ground cross ups. Jubei's pressure game here should not be underestimated and you can quickly smother an opponent with fast unpredictable pressure.\nWhile the individual slashes are minus on block, Jubei can easily choose how many swipes to go for and can deter mashing with his other Fissuring Slash followups, conditioning opponents to fear his options from it. If the opponent respects these options and avoids mashing, Jubei can opt to stop doing followups off Install Fissuring Slash's Additional Attacks and then reset pressure entirely! Resetting back again into stagger normals, instant overheads, other mix up tools, throws, and/or looping into Fissuring Slash and Additional Attacks and other follow ups all over again.\nAlso the hit boxes on this attack are pretty good at covering Jubei due to how low to the ground he gets if you decide to try this attack in neutral. It's especially important to threaten this attack as an air to air due to the quick startup for a special move. Due to how fast it moves Jubei forward you might catch an opponent off guard trying to set themselves up in the air and not expecting you to suddenly be right on top of them.  Also, the higher up you hit someone with the 5th attack, the more chance you can cause them to fly into the corner for the wall bounce, allowing you to land and link a 5B or dash 2B for an easy combo conversion!\nJubei can perform other special move followups on all but the 5th Additional Attack, so be wary about performing the final version.\nAs a final important use, this can be used to stall in the air by holding upward and doing all but 5th attack so you have no landing recovery.\nRead the special move sections below for information on their \"Fissuring Slash\" versions"

As Jubei can now vary the amount of Additional Attack slashes that occur during Fissuring Slash, choose between multiple followups that can create mix ups, or cancel to his command air dashes even while grounded to create space or do low to the ground cross ups. Jubei's pressure game here should not be underestimated and you can quickly smother an opponent with fast unpredictable pressure.\nWhile the individual slashes are minus on block, Jubei can easily choose how many swipes to go for and can deter mashing with his other Fissuring Slash followups, conditioning opponents to fear his options from it.

It's especially important to threaten this attack as an air to air due to the quick startup for a special move. Due to how fast it moves Jubei forward you might catch an opponent off guard trying to set themselves up in the air and not expecting you to suddenly be right on top of them.  Also, the higher up you hit someone with the 5th attack, the more chance you can cause them to fly into the corner for the wall bounce, allowing you to land and link a 5B or dash 2B for an easy combo conversion!\nJubei can perform other special move followups on all but the 5th Additional Attack, so be wary about performing the final version.\nAs a final important use, this can be used to stall in the air by holding upward and doing all but 5th attack so you have no landing recovery.\nRead the special move sections below for information on their \"Fissuring Slash\" versions"

On block, going for 360A after leaves a 5 frame gap that many characters cannot exploit.\nWhen used close and on a crouching opponent, Jubei can side-switch with the opponent. As this only works when opponents are crouching, this serves no purpose as a crossup but can be useful for positioning.\nWhile j.214C is a better ender for air combos due to better frame advantage and damage, j.214B lands more reliably and avoids the possibility of side-switch.\nDuring Fissuring Slash it is an effective tool to stop opponents from trying to mash out of your strings. When used from Launch it can be delayed long enough to frame trap opponents. When used from Fissuring Slash's Additional Attacks however, it must be immediately canceled into.

Generally, without counterhit or a rapid cancel comboing off of this is not possible. However, on hit it can distortion cancel into 360A, allowing Jubei to both combo and power up off a safe opener. On block, going for 360A after leaves a 5 frame gap that many characters cannot exploit.\nWhen used close and on a crouching opponent, Jubei can side-switch with the opponent. As this only works when opponents are crouching, this serves no purpose as a crossup but can be useful for positioning.\nWhile j.214C is a better ender for air combos due to better frame advantage and damage, j.214B lands more reliably and avoids the possibility of side-switch.\nDuring Fissuring Slash it is an effective tool to stop opponents from trying to mash out of your strings. When used from Launch it can be delayed long enough to frame trap opponents. When used from Fissuring Slash's Additional Attacks however, it must be immediately canceled into. From Launch, between this and 6B, Jubei has a high/low mixup that yields a combo with meter or counter hit.\nDemon Fox on the ground can be punished by Instant Blocking it and doing a 6 frame move, as it is -3. 236A > 4B version of Demon Fox is actually not 4, it's -4 (data bug/misinput).",

Can also be used off of any air normals on hit or block, giving his jump-cancelable normals greater pressure options.\nDoes not grant invulnerability and leaves Jubei in counterhit until completed so j.236D should be used with some caution during pressure or in neutral. If j.236D crosses over the opponent, aerial attacks autocorrect for slow but sure crossups.\nAs moves like 2C and enhanced 236A leave Jubei airborne on block and hit, they can be reliably canceled for greater pressure (j.236D) or safety (j.214D).\nWhen the opponent is completely cornered, if they respect Jubei's pressure j.236D becomes a stronger pressure option. When j.236D is done high into Jubei's jump arc (generally requiring a standing opponent) it will not crossup, while any lower and it will always crossup.",

The entire sword does not have a hitbox on the first two active frames, only about the first 1/4th of it. Can be late canceled into 5C on block and hit.\nDue to being a mid with a foot property, 2C interacts with other moves in notably good and/or bad ways, depending on which attribute the opponent's attack cares about. 2C will beat Tager's Sledge armor despite being a mid, lose to Azrael's 3C despite being a mid, and lose to Hakumen's 5D despite having the foot property.

Also, 3C is great in combos because of its ability to vacuum and sweep the opponent. It does have a particularly large extended hurtbox as well, so use with caution.",

The reward she gets off of j.C gives her an air-to-air corner carry combo since j.C sends the opponent fullscreen. In all instances at midscreen, you will always follow-up an air to air j.C with j.9D. As an air-to-ground button however, it's basically 5C in the air but lacks in its ability to convert off of it. Your only option is j.2C but it only combos if you're close to the opponent and even then, you can't really do much unless you spend resources, do it in the corner, or land a Counter Hit j.C.\nIn blockstrings, j.C can either continue blockstrings or end them depending on whether or not Kokonoe has a Graviton out: \nIf Kokonoe does have a Graviton out, you can use Solid Wheel as a means to continue your pressure and get yourself back down to the ground safely. Using j.2C as a gatling would be safer here since you can simply activate the Graviton to push them away or use it as a means to do airdash j.B.\nIf Kokonoe doesn't have a Graviton out, your only option without meter is to do nothing since you can't Drive cancel this move on block. The massive pushback j.C has makes this move practically unpunishable unless the opponent instant blocks it up close, but even then it can still be hard to punish it properly. Cancelling it shortens the pushback and leaves Kokonoe open to a lot of punishes so be careful.\nLike with it's grounded brother 5C, it's good in the corner as an ender for some air combo routes that'll allow you to setup Flame Cage oki guided by a Graviton.\nA little trick to know: The stalled air momentum from j.C can be useful for Kokonoe to keep herself airborne high in the air if she tries to time out the opponent. The trick to it is that you fling yourself high into the air using 236D>236B and then mash j.C to stall for as long as possible. This works even better with meter as you can use Super Ball to cover your fall.",

Rapid Cancel and do falling j.B.\nHave a Graviton setup and activate it to give you enough time to land and pick up the combo.\nUse it during Banishing Ray oki, which will put the opponent in more than enough hitstun to let you land and pick up the combo.\nUtilize j2C > j5D > jA routes (character specific, and somewhat difficult to execute consistently).\nOverdrive Cancels into falling j.B(1)>j.2C which will allow Kokonoe to land and pick them up with 5B.\nIdeally, you want to use this move if you have something to back yourself up with as j.2C suffers from forced landing recovery when used (Kokonoe can special cancel j.2C on block, but the only specials she can use in the air are Flame Cage and Solid Wheel which are ineffective, and summoning a Graviton after j.2C leaves a gap that the opponent can use to anti-air Kokonoe). Flame Cage and Banishing Rays B can give Kokonoe enough time to do j.2C>5A on block. If she has a Graviton on top of them at midscreen, she do j.2C>j.236D to push the opponent away from her.\nIf Kokonoe lands this as an air to air move or if she's close enough to the ground, she can link j.2C into 5A for a combo. j.2C>j.214214A also works too since the timing for it is very lenient (just make sure that you're close to the opponent).",

You can either use j.9D and convert off of it with Solid Wheel, or you can do j.3D>j.B(1)>j.C>j.214A to setup for Flame Cage oki.",

Leads to a full combo on hit because of the amount of hitstun it has. For similar reasons, it can also be a good combo extender if you need one and have 50 meter.\nLike with Flame Cage, Super Fireball will land a set distance depending on what button Kokonoe pressed and like with Flame Cage, Kokonoe can only have one out at a time.A Version has it land in front of Kokonoe while keeping Kokonoe slightly in place.\nB Version has it land about 1/2 of a screen length and will move Kokonoe about one character distance.\nC Version has it land almost an entire screen length away and will move Kokonoe about two character distances.\nRemains active even if Kokonoe takes damage.\nThe A version is generally the best of the three versions reversal wise and combo wise because it comes right down in front of Kokonoe and can be used to disrupt the opponent's combo on you, which will force them to either stop comboing you to block the fireball, or risk taking the hit which either way can allow you to escape pressure. However, the B and C versions can be good for catching opponents who were attempting to space out the A version. Please note that opponents can easily use moves that make them invulnerable or moves that push them out of the way to avoid Super Fireball (this applies more to the A version than it does to the B and C versions) so be careful when using Super Fireball.\nNote: There's a weird glitch where if you land Super Fireball as a counter hit on an aerial opponent, it'll launch them higher into the air as seen in this [video].\nDue to the P1 and combo timer nerf Super Fireball got in Central Fiction 2.0, Kokonoe will get less damage and time to combo off Super Fireball as a starter. Though the nerf will only come into play if she uses it as a reversal/starter, using it as a combo extender will still yield the same combos and damage as it always did."

On hit, the opponent is dropped from the top of the screen following a short delay.\nDamage is dealt to the opponent upon impact with the floor, and this damage cannot kill the opponent (they are left with 1HP when it should kill).\nAs a starter, Black Hole has a bonus proration property that increases the damage dealt of all following moves in the combo. This bonus proration appears randomly, and cannot be guaranteed.\nKokonoe is fully invincible until the super flash appears.\nOverdrive version has a stronger pull effect, and will not go off screen in the corner.\nIf this move whiffs, you will die.\nBlack Hole fundamentally functions as a reset tool, typically to guarantee a kill combo and end the round. Despite being unblockable, Black Hole sees little use in practice because of the numerous conditions required to connect it and difficulty spacing it effectively. For the same meter cost, you have access to the much simpler, stable and reliable Absolute Zero (ice) resets. Note that projectile invulnerable moves can negate blackhole entirely if done correctly (Nine omni dash for example).\nTo capitalize on the bonus proration of Black Hole, you must combo on the exact frame the opponent touches the ground. This presents difficulties due to the fact that the height from which the opponent drops is randomized between one of three options. If Black Hole whiffs, Kokonoe is incredibly vulnerable to the opponents punish of choice.\nDue to the above, Black Hole is overall strongest in situations where you need to guarantee the reset, can set it up effectively and do not need the bonus proration to kill.",

You wanna talk about complete and utter despair? Then this is the super you're looking for, Golden Tager has the power to obliterate your opponent's life lead no matter how big it is. To put it simply, this is Kokonoe's comeback Distortion.\nThere are two ways of comboing into Golden Tager that require you knowing how much time you'll get off of an Overdrive Cancel:6A>64641236C is the simpler ender of the two and can guarantee you 6-7K worth of damage (8K if Kokonoe uses certain starters). The amount of time you'll need for this ranges from 2:50sec (80% HP) to 3:25sec (50% HP)\n6A>5D>236[D]~64641236[C]~]D[~]C[ is the harder ender but in exchange for a higher learning curve, Kokonoe gains access to her highest damaging combos which usually lead to 8-10K worth of damage. In order to do these combos, you must be below 34% HP because these require the full four seconds off of the Overdrive Cancel (There do exist GT combos that involve 5D>236D>GT routes when Koko is at full health)\nOn top of being highly damaging, thanks to the Graviton buff she got in Central Fiction 2.0, Kokonoe can now combo into this move off of almost anything for a huge amount of damage, meaning that any random confirm can spell death to your opponent and Kokonoe no longer has to delay Gravitons to get these combos to work.\nKeep in mind that in order to do these combos, Kokonoe must hold back using any meter and Overdrive, both are which very valuable resources to Kokonoe as she does not possess a meterless reversal. However, being able to completely delete health bars off of a random confirm and making your opponent wonder why does she have something like this is worth holding back those resources.",

On hit, Kokonoe proceeds to bring the full artillery, to finally apply excessive electric shocks to the opponent. Puts Kokonoe in Active Flow if she hasn't already been in it already. In Central Fiction, Full Metal Heavy Weapon was rarely used as a combo ender because of its no minimum damage. Even with Active Flow, Kokonoe wasn't guaranteed much out of it unless she landed it as a reversal. \nIn Central Fiction 2.0 however, thanks to the new addition of minimum damage to all Exceed Accels, this becomes a nice combo ender if you're looking for a way to end the round and you don't have the meter for a super. Reversal wise, Kokonoe's EA has surprisingly good horizontal range as it'll hit at near Round Starting position and will launch the opponent away from her depending on which version of her EA they were hit by (Regular EA will launch them to midscreen while Active Flow EA will bring them to near fullscreen). Has full invul but is not safe on block at point blank and cannot be rapid-canceled.",

It also Fatals and leads to combos that take your opponent to the corner and do a good chunk of damage.\nMost important thing to know is that , when this move is Instant Blocked , it becomes 0 on block, which means who ever has the Fastest button will win in terms of mashing (or they might even DP you) So make sure you know when to mash 2a or when to block if you do 6D(2) vs certain characters. You might want to check other characters 2A/5A or any of their fastest startup normals.\nThat being said,  some character may do other things instead of mash , i.e. Bang may do a D move / Hakumen may Counter etc etc. Always be on your toes if you decide to use this as Pressure without special canceling it in to Itsuu.",

It can also be low profiled, making it one of the riskiest reversals in the game. However, it can be very useful - especially when used in combination with Instant Blocking. Other than as a reversal, it's used as combo filler for combo routes that prioritize damage and/or heat over okizeme or corner carry and in Overdrive combos.Be careful of moves with disjointed hitboxes, however, as these can hit you from a distance outside of Corona Upper's range.",

The fire shower is also really good at obscuring what's happening on the screen and can be a good place to try and slip in a mixup.\nIn neutral, Uvarovite can also be pretty good. The area that the fire shower comes down in is fairly large. Even throwing it out at midscreen will greatly limit the way opponents can move without getting themselves caught in the fire shower, which would allow you to get in. When the opponent is closer to the corner, Uvarovite can be especially good in neutral because they have even less places to run, making it easier to lock them down to cover an approach.",

In neutral, you can use this as a unusual spacing tool when combined with an air dash or a second jump after it whiffs for some tricky footwork. Another way to use it is to preemptively go into it on rising jump startup near the opponent to simulate a jump in attempt. j.2C's recoil effect after it whiffs / hits helps halt your position in the air for a moment which can be used as a way to dodge an opponent's initial anti air attempt if used right, then you can air dash back in for a potential hit confirm after the recoil effect.

Overall it is not as good as it us to be in previous iterations of Blazblue since its recent nerfs in CP. However, it still has its uses to an extent. You can use this reversal option at its best by using a option select to help along with proper reads and judgment calls (1 > 4+AB~D~1) to dodge some body attacks and overheads. Can be used offensively to bait most DPs, reversals, Exceed Accel, and Counter Assaults. Can also be used to hit opponents who jump during their pressure, but must be done while the opponent is still rising, since 4D no longer has Head Invuln.",

This becomes extremely useful when you become very familiar with skipping the initial drives on landings. This means you can do things like dropping directly or diagonally on your opponent while using J5C on the way down forcing them to block, quickly inputting the desired drive making your first drive the shadow step (d.6D) instead of the regular slower and a short drive 6D",

The interesting thing about this move is that it has projectile invulnerability starting on frame 5 and all the way until you land if you don't cancel it into any of the follow-ups and that it can be used to pass through the opponent in a similar way as Jubei's forward dash. The former can be useful for dodging certain, slow projectiles such as Lambda's 214D or Tsubaki's 421A. The fact that the projectile I-frames don't kick in until frame 5 and the amount of recovery attached to this move means that the situations in which you can use this trait successfully are pretty limited."

When used after a Mami Circular in the corner, your opponent cannot roll or quick getup, forcing them to neutral tech and allowing you to pressure them freely. If they do try to roll towards a bubble, they'll get caught in it and you'll get a free combo! Chances are they won't be trying that again.\nBubbles can also be used as a way to make your opponent wary to approach; throwing out a B or C bubble from fullscreen will likely make them think twice before running at you, and will give you more time to switch items to whatever you want or to approach the opponent yourself. However, the bubble can be popped by almost any attack so exercise caution when using it as cover.",

In that same light, if you have the Hammer listed as \"NEXT\" and you have 50 Heat, you'll want to use Miracle Jean the moment you recover form Mystique Momo and use the Quake for an unblockable setup.\nWith the super missiles equipped, Platinum rapidly launches her missiles one-by-one. Mainly used to punish stuff from across the screen.\nWith the bombs or super bombs equipped, Platinum launches all three bombs at once. The primary use for tossing all three bombs at once is for oki mid-screen. You'll want to cancel 3C into this and it will punish late rolls and grant you a huge amount of frame advantage.",

If Rachel uses wind towards the opponent, George will slide forward. If Rachel uses wind away from the opponent, George will walk in place. George provides Rachel with ground control, forcing opponents to take a risk to deal with George or take to the air where Rachel can control the space with Lobelias/Lotus/Sword Iris or stop air approaches with 6A or j.C. If someone commits to killing George, Rachel can take that opportunity to punish them or just summon another one.\nAnother key use of George is to force an opponent to block him on the ground, which gives Rachel time to run different mix ups. George doesn't last very long, but can keep the opponent blocking long enough for Rachel to move closer or give her more time to set up her more important tools: Lobelias and/or Lotus."

When activated, the existing rods turn into helicopter bats and home in on the opponent. The bats only travel a short distance. However, the distance/speed travelled can also be enhanced greatly by wind. Lotus do a small amount of damage on hit, but will attach on hit or block. \nWhen Lotus are attached, they can also be activated into lightning with Sword Iris while tracking the opponent as well as when they are attached to the opponent, at which point they're essentially homing rods. This makes them extremely useful for punishing someone attempting to out-zone Rachel.\nLotus has both quick startup and little recovery. As a result, it's become a strong tool to use in neutral and as oki. In neutral, it's a low risk space control tool with relatively high reward. For oki, Lotus perform a similar provides a hitbox independent of Rachel, meaning Rachel can block while Lotus is active, allowing her to easily bait reversals and command respect on her knockdown.",

It creates an wall of objects that are difficult to pass. Should the opponent pass them, however, Rachel can still perform actions on falling. The projectiles can also be manipulated using wind, allowing Rachel to blow them downwards to cover herself.\nBe VERY cautious when using this move on the ground, as some opponents with projectile invuln or full invuln charges will gladly take the opportunity to smack you out of Tempest, resulting in you losing neutral, not gaining wind, and losing 50 meter.

However, 5B alone often does not merit a lot of damage when used as a footsie, and requires other resources to maximize the reward off a maximum distance hit.\n5B can be used as an anti-air due to its speed, hitbox, and property of being air unblockable. As a starter, the move also leads into respectable damage. However, 5B's attack hitbox is at the tip of Ragna's leg and mainly around his foot, so the most efficient use would be to check the opponent's aerial approach. If the opponent seems to jump forward without dashing a lot, 5B is a good check. Keep in mind that because Ragna's attack hitbox overlaps his character hitbox, a trade or even a counter will likely happen.\nAt max range, 5B can be hit confirmed into Overdrive. With the proper combo route, the ensuing OD combo can result in over 4000 damage that provides a respectable amount of corner carry as well.",

However, the latter two options cut combo potential very early, and as a result, you miss out on both damage and heat.

The hurtbox does not extend past the hitbox, so against Distortion Drives that have long active frames, you can use 2D for a free, decent combo. The move is also very safe when spaced correctly, so it acts as a good gatling finisher. Chaining into this move from a Level 4 normal or less will leave a gap on regular block, so be careful when going into this move at close range.\nIn combos, 2D is very useful thanks to its hard knockdown on hit. At close range mid-screen or at any range in the corner, it's possible to combo 2D into Dead Spike and into a full combo. \nLifesteal: 150\nEnables use of Not Over Yet\nDash cancelable during Overdrive\nFrame advantage after earliest Dash Cancel: -2\nUnlike the normal version of 2D, 2D in Overdrive now has a Dash Cancel as well.

The special characteristics of j.D allow for a couple of mindgames, notably its incredibly short landing recovery. Overheads, lows, and throws can be performed from 6D, but it's sometimes tricky to be able to pull it off consistently.\nThe overhead is from j.D. There is absolutely no gap between 6D and j.D, no matter how late you perform j.D (unless you land before j.D comes out), so if you are close enough when 6D lands, the overhead is almost guaranteed. The only time j.D can whiff is when 6D hits too far away or the opponent barriers while slightly spaced away. Fortunately, you cannot be punished even if j.D does not hit, due to the frame advantage. The low is performed slightly differently. To perform the low, use j.D just before landing, then input 2B. Be wary that because 2B has a 9 frame start-up, many characters' fastest moves are able to beat you out. Your best bet for landing 2B in this situation is to condition the opponent to block high after 6D (using j.D), and then surprising them with 2B. Performing the throw is similar to performing the low, but it is riskier. To perform the throw, use j.D just before landing, then input throw. The hitbox on throw is very small, so any sort of barrier or spacing will cause the throw to miss. You can utilize a kara throw (B~C) to gain a tiny bit of distance so that the throw will land. Overall, use the throw option scarcely.\nSeparately, 6D also has foot invulnerability from frame 4 up until the last frame before becoming active. As a result, this move can be used against players who tend to use lows. Almost every unsafe low can be punished with a correctly timed 6D.\nLifesteal: 150\nFoot invincible on frames 4-20\nOnly cancelable to j.D\nBonus 110% proration\nFatal Counter\nOutside of combos, 6D in Overdrive functions roughly the same.

It does extend Rel's hurtbox a bit but it's well worth it. In CF it got nerfed so that it only fully extends on frame 10 however. On the bright side, now that 6C>41236B works on grounded opponents, 5B>6C comboing on counter hit makes it an even stronger punish tool! 5B>6C will also work if the starter of the combo was a fatal, so it can make confirming out of moves like 214B or 41236B easy!",

On counter hit you can choose to desummon Ignis and pick up with 5C or 2C regardless of what you choose. A new bar of IG is a great asset in a fight so it's something one should weigh against 400+ damage you'll lose for not using 5B in its place in punish or frametrap situations. In CF this move floats closer to Relius, and on airhit it doesn't pop up quite as much, so 3C>214214D will not work at lower heights.",

It's big, it's fast, it's air unblockable, and it's has untech for days on counter hit or on wallbounce. Can be used to reset opponents who air tech in the corner, or can simply be used to stop opponents from jumping out. in combos 4D is used to set-up 6A while keeping Ignis low to the ground. It's worth noting that, though it doesn't look it, the wall bounce on 4D allows for Relius to cross-under and it can create interesting oki opportunities. In CF 4D lost SMP and gained 110% bonus prorate for the first use in a combo, making it an ideal follow-up to Lauger in the corner.",

They are also are jump cancelable even on block! If Ignis is already nearby this move becomes insanely quick, 12 frames for a large attack that can occur fullscreen. With Ignis' natural ability to absorb projectiles this move is prerfect for interfering with opponents setting up far away from you. Similar to j.D, it can be used to halt momentum, initiate a glide from an airdash, and bait or dodge moves. When used from an airbackdash the effective space covered increases and when used with a forward airdash the effective range shrinks. j.6D can also be used to position Ignis forward from Relius.",

Does slightly less damage than ~214B/~j.214B but does not put Ignis in sandwich mode. In CF Ignis now appears at the height Relius is currently at, and she does not cause the opponent to ground slide instead letting them emergency tech. when the opponent is air-hit by the move one now has to manually time the move to hit, preferably at the last active it can. Forgetting this can make 236C~214A whiff completely if the opponent was high up when 236C connected. The P2 has also been decreased so 4D is the more optimal move to continue from 236C with if 4D's bonus proration hasn't been used in the combo prior to 236C. The loss of vertical tracking can let you set up an inescapable Val Tus oki from 2C>6C>236C~214A midscreen if timed correctly. In the corner ~214A can be followed up with 5B, 3C, or 2C. In the corner, ~j.214A can follow up into 5B 3C or airdash j.B>j.C>j.236C>4D usually. In OD this move has a lot of untech and puts the opponent in a sliding state. You can use the OD version to desummon Ignis in the corner and follow up.",

If input as 2366A it can be given dash momentum which will at times let it avoid grab hitboxes or put a for in the corner in your stead. Ignis is free to 6D 4D or 2D during the whole thing so it can even be used to dodge and counter pokes.

Gad Leis Fatals on counter-hit, and can combo into 5B>6C pretty easily to convert from it. Gad Leis is no longer + on block however, so it's wise to have Ignis or meter to cover it. It's P2 isn't that stellar now, so it's something to avoid early in a combo if you're going for higher end damage. At midscreen the change to SMP lets us loop this move for IG optimal damage.",

If blocked, the further away the move was blocked from Ignis' origin point the less - it will be. (even becoming + in some very rare isolated incidences.)

Relius doesn't get any worthwhile oki from this. One can use 6D>2D to get oki on a neutral teching opponent if Ignis is out during Varias, however that's 33% IG for pretty poor oki.

As a result, many combos go into this before branching into whatever specific route is available in the situation, making this a staple in your extended combo game. Keep in mind where your opponent is when you use it, as your available routes may depend on the type of knockdown you get (e.g. 6D > Crush Trigger/lvl 1 Hunter's Fang will fail if they groundslide away midscreen).\nBecause its initial hitboxes are very high up, you'll only hit opponents who are crouching or a distance away with the later hitboxes, effectively giving this move 25 frames of startup and making it -8 on block. While 6D has similar shortcomings to 2D in its lack of cancels on block, its good range and pushback can also make it a deceptively good overhead, though spacing will be necessary if you plan to use this in pressure without getting lit up.

This is also coupled with no invulnerabilities, guardpoints or low profiling so you'll have to treat this differently from most commands grabs to get any mileage out of it. Also note that it will generally lose to other command grabs that have greater reach, such as both of Tager's 360s, since Susanno's hitbox is pretty much touching range when using this move. However because it can never be throw rejected for any reason, it can be a powerful tool when your opponent is teching since it's easy to get a meaty hit (Where they must start jumping or using a reversal as soon as possible to avoid it). Very powerful if you do land a hit with it since you're guarenteed to corner your opponent with them teching at your feet.",

However, using this can be good if you have been put at an early disadvantage to try and get back into the game or as a reason to get good milage out of a short overdrive, since unlocking all of your specials is similar to just having a permanent overdrive.

It has a very nice frame advantage making it ideal for setting up Wedge catapault attempts, deliberate whiffs on techs and other shenanigans. 2B's relatively short range limits its use to just an oki tool in many cases since it's not easy or practical for Tager to close in unimpeded most of the time.",

It brings the opponent closer to him, allowing him to start close range pressure and grab mixup. It also is a very good combo tool that removes the need to dash or jump cancel like other characters would need to.  Usually in combos it gets used after a 5C, a link which eventually fails during long combos. Other times include after Sledgehammer B, Back throw and, with some timing, Spark bolt and j.D.\nThis move also has a strange property where the ground-sliding animation and untech time lasts MUCH longer when the opponent is hit by this at a low height. The untech time is long enough to allow combos of all kinds. The normal version will generally only combo into 2C, 6B and 236A but if you get the long-untech time version, 6A will combo into B sledge, 6C, and Crush Trigger as well, allowing a lot of combo possibilities.",

You can also use it to delay your jump-in momentum to call out anti-air attacks, but you won't get a counterhit that way usually, on hitting a grounded opponent, you usually only have time for gadget finger, if at all, but you can rapid cancel the fall to eliminate the landing recovery and pick the combo up with 5B. It's still very risky however, since it's very punishable on block.\nIn combos this move is very frequently used after 6C to bring the opponent back down to earth. Ensure you hit them as with Tager as low as you can to give yourself time to recover and use 5B. \nThe quick start up version seems to be a bug that was deliberately left in the game where the game cancels much of the startup into the landing animation (which has some active frames). This quick version is useful for getting surprise fatal counters on jump ins, and is also quite safe. However its use is very limited due to the rather precise height you need to be to activate it. Bizarrely enough it's still an overhead when you do this.",

It is an all around useful normal, which can be used in combos, a long range big poke, counter hit fishing (trying to force a counter hit), sometimes also for frame traps and as a situational anti-air. However, overusing 5D too much will lead to painful CH combos against Tager because of its slow speed, so use but don't abuse.

Consequently, this variation is about as fast as his old B version Driver with holding extending his active time, but has similar invulnerability  and does the same damage as his classic A Driver. The 6 frame startup and short invulnerability means it can be used as a weak reversal and to win close range jab pressure, but be wary of being predictable as it is extremely punishable and vunlerable to jump cancels, frametraps and meaty attacks. As with all of Tager's meterless grabs, you'll want to follow this up with Gadget Finger, nothing else will work (There's no RC option either).\nWhile it might seem as a Grappler that your gameplan should revolve around landing this move, it actually only leads to weak damage compared to Tager's other options. Typically you'll need to use this move to keep your opponent from doing bad blockstrings on the ground and also to win out point-blank jab contests when at near-neutral frame advantage, forcing your opponent to play less aggressively. Players playing against you will fear this move and you can use this to make them make other mistakes instead.",

It sees most usage as a tool for calling out moves and even an anti-jump in due to the generous invulnerability window between frames 6-30. However it has a slow, 30 frame startup, and 30 frames of recovery, meaning that abusing it or whiffing it will lead to eating a painful punish. \nWedge Catapault, like Atomic Collider, doesn't purple throw mid-combo, meaning that you can use it as a combo tool in some situations (After a 5D standing Counterhit for example). As a starter, it allows for followup combos with 6c or a delayed 5c, though the overall damage from a combo with Wedge as the starter is somewhat low. The Catapult itself prevents the opponent from teching whilst they're spinning in midair, meaning that until they hit the ground there's no way to get away from the follow-up combo, or the follow-up, Impact Driver. Which route you go will depend largely on how much health they have left, with the combo giving more damage overall.\nWhile it has an excellent P2, making it great for use in combos, be aware that the move requires a lot of time to fully perform, meaning that the remaining combo will be cut short due to hitstun decay.\nWhilst it's not a great move to use on wakeup, you can use Wedge immediately after Gadget Finger to punish players who don't respect your grabs and remain grounded.\nThe moves this can be comboed into are as follows:\nGadget Finger (needs Rapid cancel)\n5D Counter hit\nj.D Counterhit (When performed very low to the ground)\nB Sledgehammer counterhit\n6A Max Charge Counterhit",

Allows easy followups.\nIt autoguards projectiles during start-up and active frames and Head and Body attacks during start-up.\nProjectile guardpoint deletes projectiles rather than blocking them, so projectiles do not inflict hitstop or any on-block effects. Unblockable projectiles still cannot be blocked with this move however.\nOften used to close gaps and punch through reckless projectile spam, but it's far from ideal since it's your only real way to do this.\nUsed in corner combos after a 5D air hit.\nNot necessarily the best way to close gaps as predictable Sledge use will usually be punished. Vary between using this, super jump Tager Plane and simply taking a nice stroll towards the opponent to keep them guessing. In combos it works as a great move due to its huge damage, decent scaling and can be followed with 6A > 6C fairly easily if you scoop them off the floor with it (Such as after a 3C counterhit or a 5D air hit into the corner).",

                        "Description": "Tager picks up the opponent from the floor, magnetises them (360F normally, 1000F during OD) and drops them back down, now further then previous versions. Used for okizeme, combos and timeouts.\nAttractive to mangnetised opponents during startup and active frames.\nHold D to extend active frames.\nDisables opponent's burst until they recover.\nWhile it looks like it can only pick enemies off the floor, it is able to catch opponents in the airborne state (Which includes lying on the floor and jumping). The hitbox rises up enough enough to do combos where your opponent falls into an active gadget finger before they get a chance to tech as they reach the floor. For example 3C > 22D will connect.\nOnly usable if the combo you're doing has fully downed your opponent at least once (Floorbounces do not count).\nThese moves that force downed state are, 6B (Air hit only), 5D and 2D (Air hit only, only after floorslide begins), Crush Trigger, 360A, j.360C, impact driver, j.2C (non CH only), Air throw.\n3C and Atomic collider have a special property where your opponent is considered to have been downed in the combo the instant these attacks connect.\nAny move where your opponent doesn't tech before going fully downed will also count, but will obviously be a blue combo.\nUniquely, The opponent is dropped in the air in a standing histun state, leading to some odd properties:\nWhen the opponent touches the floor, they do not get any ukemi options, instead they recover just like if they'd been hit while standing.\nThe recovery from the move only begins once they touch the floor. So if they're magnetised and Tager uses an RC, he can fling the opponent around and they will be completely unable to tech until they reach the floor.\nThe recovery is affected as normal by combo length, fatal counter and, in the case of Jubei, crouching hitstun.\nNow actually has enough advantage to followup with 5A on certain characters (Subject to hitboxes), and even more on Fatal.\n100% minimum damage. Fixed 5% heat gain.\nTager's Gadget Finger is as good as ever, and still used for a lot of things. The most obvious use is to use this as an okizeme tool. It's fast enough to combo after his \"Driver\" command throws, giving him easy pressure afterward, albeit one that can be disrespected with Overdrive, DP's and EA. However, with the right conditioning and setup, they won't dare to do so.\nHowever, a smart player quickly notices that Gadget Finger allows much more than this option. For starters, it actually has infinite untech time due to it putting them in grounded hitstun in the air, which leads into two things\u00a0: it allows the now infamous Timeout Tager loop (or \"the circus\"), or for new gimmicky combos.\nThe timeout is done by doing Gadget Finger, rapid-cancelling it and repeatedly doing whiffed Air Drivers (360C). This is much harder than it sounds, and must be done with great care to not launch the opponent too far away, or too high for another successful Driver whiff. If done correctly, with 100 meter, it can easily grant Tager a timeout win even when a lot of time is remaining in the match.\nEven though GF drops farther back now, it actually had it's advantage after it increased, now allowing Tager to followup with 5A on characters like Arakune, Susanoo and another Tager. Fatal Counter allows GF > Spark Bolt on pretty much anyone, 5B on Tager, 5A > 3C on larger and wonky hitbox characters and even allows GF RC > 360B if the combo started with an FC. These combo paths however are more on the impractical side of the spectrum so it's better not to use them in serious gameplay.\nOverall, with the new timeout and combos it gives, GF became a much more useful and threatening tool, while it's okizeme potential is left unchanged (it's harder to maintain it though due to the bigger distance between Tager and the enemy). Smart use of this move will pay off incredibly well, a 700-800 damage at the end of any combo via 360Bx2 isn't that bad either!",

In this instance Voltic charge loses its bonus spark bolt gain.\nA special move, therefore other moves can be cancelled into this to bait bursts and also a gimmicky way to make some moves \"safe\" on block.\nDue to the slow nature of cancelling into additional attack, which also only has a standing and projectile guard, your opponent can notice they've hit your guard point and simply cancel their blockstring into a low hit and score and easy counter hit on you. Therefore this is inadvisble to use to trap grounded attacks unless you're doing a hard read on a reversal (which typically don't hit low). Useful against air jump ins however, but beware of crossup attacks, even if your opponent has completely crossed over by the time you start using 236A, Tager will not change facing and will therefore do the additional attack the wrong way.",

Also not an overhead.\nCan be used as a ghetto double jump to perform crossups and bait out anti-air attacks.\nAir combo finisher with big damage. Can be Rapid cancelled on either hit to continue the combo, although this is only worth doing early in the combo. There also exists some cases where the second hit will not actually connect, either due to the smack down attack being techable (only happens in some very long combos) or some external forces causing Tager's fall to miss (such as another Tager's magnetism before the attack hit).",

It's not advised if you landed MTW as the first hit of the combo, you will actually get more damage by using a rapid cancel to create a followup combo than by using Terra Break. Similarly, even though it has some invulnerability, do not attempt to use it if MTW gets blocked, use a rapid cancel instead!\nIf you manage to use it during overdrive however, it will deal more damage and wallbounces for even more followup hits (Including using exceed accel!).

Ideally used more as a reversal than a punish unless you really need your combo to be burst proof or your punish window isn't large enough for 5C to connect. This isn't a move to be thrown out lightly since anyone familiar with fighting against Tager will be keen to bait this move out with their own jump cancellable normals and other throw safe moves. Try to use it at more unpredictable times or in conjunction with Overdrive to see if they're vulnerable before committing your heat as well (You can easily buffer this move during overdrive startup). Remember to take advantage of the fact that it can pull in enemies from surprising distances before it goes active, for example, you can use it to catch Ragna using his 5B at full range if he is magnetised.\nSadly, unlike other Distortion drives, this move requires you to commit 50 Heat up front to even attempt it (There's no way to combo into it), and even if it hits, you have no way to follow it up with any other move and they are free to tech roll away. For this reason you generally want to use this as a round ender rather than a way to do big damage mid round.",

The beginning looks slightly similar to 6A so it can be used for an ambiguous mix-up against players who are not too familiar with Tsubaki's normals. On CH, it causes the opponent to trip, but in CF, 6BB is fast enough to catch the falling opponent, allowing a short combo, or a longer one with charge.\nThis normal has changed substantially in CF - it comes out much faster now, allowing it to combo from 5B without needing a counter hit, and allowing it to catch people trying to jump out after 5B/5C;  However, it is no longer plus on block, making it a somewhat riskier place to reset pressure.  However, the threat of 6BB, Fireball, and Hammer can be enough to keep the opponent guessing here and allow a pressure reset if you aren't too predictable.",

Using the slide on air hit after a CH 6B can be followed up with 236D midscreen if you have the resources to do so which makes the confirm out of the CH much easier.

Cancelling into 421A can be used to extend pressure if the opponent insists on staying grounded since you can run in while the opponent is blocking the projectile.

It is mostly used in combos, after j.C hit confirms, or for an added overhead after a blocked j.C. Using j.CC actually cancels out Tsubaki's downward momentum in the air and makes her float momentarily. The short hop that she does can be used as both a mixup and a frame trap after a j.C that is done very close to the ground. It can also be used as a movement tool, as it causes Tsubaki to \"glide\" a bit during an air dash because of this attribute.  If close enough to the ground, you can combo into 5A, 5B, or 5C. This usually happens if you jump-in on your opponent first with j.C and then delay the j.CC a little bit as if you were doing an IAD combo and then land to continue.",

If charging is started with an empty bar, from 0 to 1 stocks will take ~44 frames (~3/4 of a second) while 4 to 5 takes nearly half the time at ~26 frames (~3/7 of a second).\nThis is the main method of charging (or using charge cancels) you will use and it's necessary to make a balance between using this to gain resources and rushdown. Notice that you should be focused on gaining charge when you are quite far from your opponent, or when you have knocked them down, as Tsubaki is vulnerable in this state. If you're pressuring your opponent, the emphasis should be on giving yourself more mixup opportunities and staying on your opponent.

May make them misjudge distance or unconsciously continue to block low just from the visual cues. It seems to make running up and grabbing or command grabbing after the charge cancel a lot more surprising for some reason. Since she is around as short as her crouching state while using 2D, certain jabs may actually whiff if the opponent attempts to smack you while you are doing charge cancels instead of upbacking away or using a reversal.

The charge rate depends on how high off the ground you start to charge.

When in Overdrive, the reduced recovery allows j.C and j.CC to be linked to another j.C which slightly increases combo damage. Requires special spacing in the air usually involving super jumps and can only really be fully utilized for extra damage if your air option has not already been used so that you can jump again after j.B/A, but it does get you a tiny bit of charge mid-combo and a slightly more corner carry if you do pull it off. There is even a super secret corner combo route that can be used by cancelling into j.D after j.236A that nets an even larger fraction of an install stock.",

It is a versatile special added in CF that helps Tsubaki maintain close-range for pressure while also being a relatively safe potential starter on its own.\nThe final attack in Tsubaki's string of special attacks that bounces or knocks the opponent down. Tsubaki leaps forward and swings a hammer overhead, forcing the opponent to block high while avoiding potential lows. It has frame advantage on block and can be used on almost all of Tsubaki's normals, making it a great way to continue pressure as it allows her to close distance relatively easily. Due to its high startup it can be interrupted by a wary opponent, but because of the many options it can be canceled off of, an opponent might be hesitant to call it out.\nThe B version hits once with the hammer, bouncing the opponent off the ground. It can be followed up easily with a  large variety of normals with the most common one being 5C. While using it as a way to close distance has its advantages, the opponent may be expectant of this. If the opponent respects Tsubaki's close-range pressure, it may be useful to throw out as a potential mixup at a closer distance. \nThe followup B version knocks the opponent to the ground. Without meter it cannot be followed up as the opponent can quickly tech once knocked down. As followups are unlikely, it is typically canceled with 5D/2D. Cancelling into 5D/2D after knocking the opponent down with it speeds up charge generation for a few frames which guarantees a certain amount of a charge after ending a combo, though this can only be done after the B version.

It has a lot of recovery making it very easy to punish, so use with caution, especially if you don't have the charge to followup. Has a lot of vertical active frames making it possible to snipe oppponents out of the air if they don't barrier block, but this should not be abused as it is horrible if whiffed or barrier blocked. Not very good to use as an anti air because of the awkward hitbox and the deadzone between Tsubaki and the actual hitbox which allows opponents to sometimes hop over the active portion of the DP and hit Tsubaki who will be stuck in the animation of the DP.\nThe C version fires a single pillar upward towards the sky which is actually active the entire time it is on screen. It launches the opponent and can be cancelled into the air specials j.236A and j.214A on hit in order to get a knockdown immediately in front of Tsubaki when she lands. If the move is whiffed or blocked, it can be cancelled into the D versions of those moves in order to make the reversal somewhat safer if called by the opponent. Using j.214D completely prevents a the opponent from scoring a counterhit on you since it replaces the recovery of the DP, but they can still punish you if they are competent, so do not rely on the followups to save you 100% of the time. Using j.236D will move you backward and fire a projectile, but you will still be in counterhit state until you touch the ground.\nThe D version fires three small pillars out of the ground and deals slightly more damage than the C version. It is really only used in Mugen combos, but it has utility outside of them. It has slightly more invulnerability and slightly less recovery compared to the C version. It also allows for proper followups after the reversal when cancelling to the D versions of the air specials which are not possibly by using the C version.\nIn this iteration of the game in particular, the combo route stemming from this special is emphasized since it can be consistently followed up thanks to it launching both Tsubaki and the opponent fairly low off the ground. By getting rid of the landing recovery of the DP through either immediately cancelling into a whiffed j.214A/B or late cancelling into a whiffed j.236A as Tsubaki is about to touch the ground 5A, 5B, or 5C can be used as a followup to catch the falling opponent. The most popular route is the delayed j.236A route as it is the least execution heavy, the most consistent, and allows the strongest followup, 5C to be used properly. The reason why this is such a powerful combo route is the fact that it allows you to start up a juggle without requiring a crouching confirm or an anti-air hit. This allows Tsubaki to get in a larger number of her more damaging normals and carry to the corner more effectively. Some of her chargeless and meterless combos off of normals like 5B can break 3000 damage midscreen thanks to this route, so this special is of the utmost importance."

The orb released by this special is perfect to use in neutral to control movement, shield approaches, and create opportunities to charge. Be careful when using this while higher in the air or when your opponent is nearby because its startup isn't the fastest and its recovery lasts until Tsubaki touches the ground. If you are too high up, your opponent can simply walk right under the projectile and it may even disappear before touching the ground since it is only on the screen for a limited amount of time. A handy trick to getting the projectile out safely is to tiger knee the special input (2369A) which makes the special happen right out of jump startup and very close to the ground.\nThe A version fires a pink orb and moves Tsubaki slightly backward while in the air. Its projectile can be used in neutral as stated above and even for oki in the corner (using a certain right combo path). Using this move before one of the j.214X series to end an air combo changes the properties of the knockdown since the followup versions are used instead of the regular ones. Has combo potential in the corner in conjunction with j.D by linking j.B while the opponent is still in hitstun from the orb. The accelerated charge speed caused by cancelling this move into j.D generates a minimum of 0.5 charges before going back to the regular charge rate.\nThe followup A version does not launch a projectile. You will only really see this version after a DP since it is the only way to access the followup version. Nothing really that special about it aside from it doing less damage. The accelerated charge speed caused by cancelling this move into j.D generates a minimum of 0.25 charges before going back to the regular charge rate.\nThe D version fires a larger white orb and moves Tsubaki slightly forward while in the air. Although its projectile can be used just like the A version's projectile, it costs a charge so it really isn't worth it. Just like 623D, it sees most of its use while under the influence of Mugen, but when used together, a decent followup combo can come out of a successful reversal. If j.214D is used directly after this special, it will active the aura and change the properties of the move entirely and allow for a stronger followup from an air combo than j.214D by itself.\nThe followup D version still launches a projectile.

Cancelling into 5D or 2D after grounding the opponent speeds up charge generation for a few frames which guarantees a certain amount of a charge after ending a combo just like 22B. Just like the 22X series, this cannot be done after the D version of the special. If your back is to the corner, it can be used after a super jump to scale the screen and run away from your opponent. Not that great of an idea to use in neutral as an approach or in pressure unless you have the meter to cancel its recovery.\nThe A version travels at a -60\u00b0 angle from your position in the air during the dive and covers the least distance with the B and C versions travelling at a -45\u00b0 angle and a -30\u00b0 angle respectively. It is the primary way to end a combo because of its fast startup and the fact that the damage tacked on by a non-super ender in the combo does not make much of a difference to the overall combo damage. Causes knockdown that has an emergency tech window which will force neutral tech if the opponent is holding A, B, or C regardless of which direction they are holding. Opponents that delay their tech by not holding a button in order to roll or quick tech run the risk of getting hit with 2A and allowing Tsubaki to continue with a combo and get more corner carry. The accelerated charge speed caused by cancelling this move into 5D/2D generates a minimum of 0.5 charges before going back to the regular charge rate.\nThe followup A, B, and C versions cause a bit of slide and hard knockdown instead of having an emergency tech window which encourages most opponents to roll after you end a combo in this fashion. The followup properties can be attained by special cancelling out of either the 623X series or j.236X series. The accelerated charge speed caused by cancelling this move into 5D/2D generates a minimum of 0.25 charges before going back to the regular charge rate.\nThe D version knocks the opponent down and delivers a slight bounce that extends their untechable time. By dashing you can pick the opponent back up and go into another full air combo or end in a super. This move is essential as it allows any air combo to be converted into a ridiculous amount of damage and corner carry from anywhere on the screen. 2A after the post-landing dash is the simplest way to follow up the special, but it doesn't do that much damage and and prorates the combo pretty badly, so if you have trust in your execution you can go for 623C and catch with 5C to continue the combo. Of course, 623C prorates the combo nearly as bad as 5A, but it deals nearly triple the damage that 5A deals.\nThe followup D version descends at an angle similar to the regular A version and does not deliver a long enough knockdown to be followed up. Though rare to witness this lack of untech time in combos, this effect can be seen very often when autopiloted 623C > j.214D confirmed instead of blocked."

This is really only combo filler, but is it often used when trying to cover up for a whiffed or blocked 623C if you are afraid of getting punished even after spending a charge to cancel into j.236D.

It also places you at a good advantage if blocked so you can apply pressure, but you can still lose to DPs and some characters may be able to use their backdash to make it whiff. If the opponent is wary of this combination special, you can send out only 421D's projectile without whiff cancelling into 236D and go for an IAD to punish them trying to bait it.

The startup is very fast, matching her 5C so it's definitely something to consider especially if you're having a difficult time opening up your opponent. Remember that if this is used on your opponent's wakeup they can avoid it by jumping, and this is why you would mix it up by using 5C. 5C is a great combo starter and will hit if opponent try to jump on their wakeup. It's all about conditioning your opponent. There are many setups you can use with this command grab so please check out the strategy guide. \nIf you do RC this attack and need to followup, your most common options would be 2C > 214B, 22[D] > 6C, and CT > 6C.",

It can be used from fullscreen as a neutral tool to help Tsubaki get in against zoning characters or to get space to charge against rushdown characters. It can also be used to lock the opponent down and force a mixup upon them after a knockdown. Since it is invulnerable from 16F on, using it after a knockdown will evade any of the opponent's reversal attempts. If it hits you can confirm into j.C for a smidgen of damage and another knockdown. However, it is possible to hit her out of it during start-up when the blades are still coming out so it is not recommended to be used as if it were a reversal super. Many opponents like to CA during this super so if they have the meter it is advised to be on the look out and bait it if possible.\nWhile in Overdrive, the summoned projectiles change their appearance and instead of knocking the opponent back, they actually hold the opponent in place like Rachel's Tempest Dahlia even if they are in the air or barriering.",

Due to 5C only being -2 on block, it can sometimes be used as a tick throw option. Terumi is also considered airborne at around the first active frame, so it can also be used as a throw bait if timed right.\n5C can be jump canceled on the first hit; however you cannot double jump or air dash after jump-canceling. It is strongly advised you do this if they do an overdrive raid on the first hit because it will make the second hit miss and open you up for a punish. In pressure you can jump cancel the first hit and follow up with J.2D to extend your pressure, this is gapless (assuming you did it as clean as possible) on most hitboxes (leaving you at +2 though instead of +3) and leaves a 1-frame gap on shorter hitboxes (Mai, Bullet....) (and leaves you at +3) \nWith meter this move can be used for mixups as rapid cancelling the first hit puts you airborne, so you can for a nasty J.A/J.B overhead, you can also wait till right before the second lands and RC into a throw or low.\nCuriously, the second part of the move is programmed to only activate when Terumi vertical velocity hits zero, so if some external force launches him upwards (Such as Kokonoe's Gravitron), Terumi will be stuck in recovery from the first part of this attack until he starts falling.",

However, it cannot be canceled into anything but a Rapid Cancel, but it is possible to combo after it without meter on Counter Hit. It is very unsafe on block and whiff (and also puts you in a Counter hit state for the recovery's duration) so if this does not connect or there is not enough meter to Rapid Cancel, Terumi will be punished heavily for it. Fortunately, however, Terumi gains so much meter for RCs that this is generally safe to use at short range and can lead to big damage should you call correctly and score a nice counterhit. Beware that instant blocking the second hit leaves a small gap which your opponent can perform a reversal with, so waiting for the third hit before rapid cancelling is not foolproof.",

If it connects, he shoots another chain and lifts the opponent into the air. He then pulls himself to the opponent, inflicting great pain with his mightily kicks and slashes. In the great final, he lunges into his victim from above while covered in his diabolic energy resembling a green lindworm and devours them, including their screams of pain.\nCosts 100 Heat and has a good amount of invulnerability. It guard-crushes on normal guard, and if Barrier Blocked, it pulls his opponent to him, leaving him/her in a good position. This is mainly used to close out matches midscreen and against zoners to blow up projectile throwers and punish them fiercely. Has a minimum distance at which the opponent must be away from Terumi (roughly half screen; anti-air version is roughly 1 1/2 character lengths, although if they are too close, it becomes inconsistent) or it will completely pass through the opponent.\nOD versions are completely unblockable. Because if this, it can be used to play mind games with the opponent or on Overdrive Raid (GCOD) against projectiles to punish them for massive damage.\nLast hit can be cancelled into Terumi's Exceed Accel for insane damage.",

Guard point is from 5f so it's not recommended as a reversal on wakeup as it can lose to meaty attacks, throws and lows. Sometimes the better option is to just block on wakeup. It's even difficult to use during an opponent's pressure but it can be good to use when calling out obvious attempts. It can be used as a situational AA but the range makes it very unreliable, and as you cannot cancel this normal, you'll be vulnerable on whiff or block. You cannot followup from this attack on a normal hit but if you manage to land a CH you can followup into 5C or 3C.",

It can be used in a blockstring to discourage your opponent from mashing. 6C provides the opportunity for wolf cancel mixup but this is generally unsafe to do. 6C also shrinks Valkenhayn's horizontal hitbox so it can be useful against certain characters in neutral, such as Makoto and Azrael.\nAs of CF, now cancels into 6B and 3C.",

You do not want to be in that position because Valkenhayn is quite frail defensively. It should definitely not be used in an attempt to wolf cancel it into more pressure because it can easily be mashed out of. It does cover a lot of ground however so it is an option when you're low on wolf meter. It may be better to catch your opponent in the air as it causes a blowback on air hit.

If you hit with this attack, you can use either of the following followups (can depend on spacing:Run a little w[5C > 6D > j.A] - If you have them in the corner\nRun a little w[5B > j.C > j.236B > 6D > j.B] - If you have your back to the corner and you want to get them in the corner\nRun a little w[5B > j.C > j.236B > 1D > j.D > 2C] - If you're midscreen and you're going for damage.\nAlternatively you could use the w[5B > IAD j.B > j.C] wolf combo for more corner carry or go back to human form and combo with 3C if you're low on wolf meter.\nWolf cannons also don't have to be used offensively, but they also provide another means of wolf movement. It doesn't cost much more wolf meter to use so it's well worth using it provided you can combine it with followup movements such as 7D > 4C wolf brake."

If the second hit does not connect (the one while landing), then the last hit will not come out. You can also recharge low wolf meter with this ender but not as much as sturm because Valkenhayn eventually jumps into the air, halting the wolf gauge. Another important factor to consider is that this should only be used when you're going for the kill as the opponent has the option to roll forward and past you, making you lose any form of oki you had planned. However, there is a way to counter this, but you will need 50 meter. After a Konig Flug in the corner, at the end of the recovery, input 412364D. This is an option select. If the opponent rolls behind you, Sturm wolf will activate and hit them, but if you're too quick you'll end up in front of them and the attacks will whiff. If the opponent does not roll you'll get a w4D backdash.\nThis attack can also be RC'd on the 2nd hit which will make your opponent float in the air for some time. The timing is a little difficult to get used to, but is it useful if you need to get the little extra damage in to go for the kill.",

The late-chain into itself allows you to be a lot less predictable with your blockstrings, and can level up your pressure from a character whose pressure is only sub-par.

It does lose the ability to jump cancel, but gains hitting low in its place. 2B excels at everything from poking to use as a cross-under normal, and its liberal application should never be underestimated.

This move will be seen in nearly every corner combo (And some midscreen ones for the corner carry). It will nearly always combo from 5C regardless of context (Crouching, ch, etc). Some characters will need 6C to be spaced slightly less due to smaller hurtboxes interacting with its dead zone (Particularly wallsplat hurtboxes in corners). 6C can be used in blockstrings as a frame trap or simply to push your opponent farther away and giving you even more blockstun to drive cancel or special cancel into something, but do not forget that this IS a frametrap and always will be without a very precisely timed stein so autopiloting into this is ill advised.",

Up to 4 of them can be placed at once with any over that number deleting the oldest stein.\nWhile at the surface they might seem rather underwhelming, their true strength and a major aspect of playing Mu is the sheer number of things you can use both the laser shot itself for, the specials using them and the actions you can cancel into from a stein placement as well as the ability to cancel buttons into steins on both hit and block. Any of Mu's buttons can be canceled into a stein placement and she can cancel any stein placement into: Jump, Special/Super, and any C normal.

Mu herself only animates the move for the listed recovery time.\nAny version can cancel into any other (Including charged versions), but only once per chain.\nStein Cancel Lockouts are as follows and apply to both whiff and jump cancels: 4d=14f, 5d=15f, 6d=16f, 2d=18f.\nAh yes, the steins. Without them Mu wouldn't be...well Mu. As mentioned above, steins shoot a laser after a predetermined amount of time following deployment. This laser travels roughly half a screen away from the steins position before disappearing. Afterwards the stein will remain on screen for use with 2 of her specials and one of her distortions. Up to 4 of them can be placed at once with any over that number deleting the oldest stein.\nWhile at the surface they might seem rather underwhelming, their true strength and a major aspect of playing Mu is the sheer number of things you can use both the laser shot itself for, the specials using them and the actions you can cancel into from a stein placement as well as the ability to cancel buttons into steins on both hit and block. Any of Mu's buttons can be canceled into a stein placement and she can cancel any stein placement into: Jump, Special/Super, and any C normal. The number and complexity of things you can do with steins could take an entire page to cover alone so play around with them yourself and you might just find one!",

In exchange you lose the ability to stein cancel said recovery. Its also exceptionally plus on RC with 2b becoming airtight should they block or lead to nice corner carry and a confirm should it hit.  As for use in combos it ground slides making it great for extending combos near/in the corner. SoD is also a standard ender in many combos including mid screen with some of Mu's more zoning oriented matchups to send them away from you.\nCharged: Purely a combo tool. The charged version gives you a wall bounce and a ton of untech time so its found in many corner routes. It should go without saying using this for much else is a bad idea as its both slow and little to no more safe than the uncharged version.

It forces your opponent to block, even when they are hitting Mu after the laser comes out due to the laser aiming at Mu's opponent after it has passed through the last stein. The gaps between 236D and her strings are variable due to placement of steins and which attacks Mu uses to force her opponent to block which could lead to ambiguous mix ups/frame traps.\nThis move is best used when Mu is relatively far from her opponent or right as her opponent is knocked down to the ground so she has time to set up the laser as it has quite a bit of startup. The faster laser means less blockstun, and multiple steins are recommended when using this move, to guarantee at least some effectiveness.

While its functions overlap somewhat with Totsuka, it nevertheless is overall an improvement over Habakiri as it retains a use in combos while also becoming more useful in neutral as a lower recovery alternative to Totsuka.
