Furthermore, this move can cancel into 2C and Gauntlet Hades, giving Ragna a high/low mix-up as well. Be wary of Reject Guards, as the second hit is horribly unsafe on whiff. In combos, this move can loop into and from A Dead Spike on an airborne opponent. Can also go into Ragna's j.C > Gauntlet Hades loop in the same scenario.\n",

Can only be canceled into Cross Raid if Ragna's partner is currently in the back line (cannot be super canceled in Resonance Blaze). Due to the extreme horizontal knockback on hit, Partner Skills must be called pre-emptively for them to successfully connect when used mid-screen. At max height in the corner, this move produces safe jump oki. Note that if hitstun is low, the opponent can air tech before reaching the ground.\n",

This move has fantastic scaling as a starter, leading into high damage with only one stock of Skill Gauge, although such a starter is unlikely as it is locked behind 5B, meaning that this can only occur as part of a niche frame trap. Thanks to its multi-hit nature, 5BB can be used to Active Change mid-combo fairly easily but this trait also makes it very unsafe on whiff.

Late air normal cancels will eliminate 2B's recovery without attacking, allowing Ragna to go low with 2A instead. Performing delay 2B after 5B on hit and then whiffing j.B enables rejump combos, leading into strong, mid-screen combo routes. Can combo directly into 5A on Counter Hit.\n",

Against grounded opponents, Ragna can use quick specials like Hell's Fang and Inferno Divider to follow it up, though Counter Hits allow for better damage with Gauntlet Hades or Blood Scythe. Be warned, it's not ideal to use versus grounded opponents other than for an extremely rare anti-air callout due to j.C's brief stop in the air.

Very slow, making it a poor choice for Cross Burst punishes as the opponent will recover from their Cross Burst before it hits. In return, the ground bounce on hit makes it very easy to convert into a combo, including moves that normally have too much start-up to be practical. Some characters can even call this assist then use their Reversal Action to anti-air which results in Ragna keeping the opponent in hitstun long enough for the point character to convert the hit into a full combo. Note that doing so will remove the Reversal Action's invulnerability so only do so if the opponent is up-backing out of pressure. Very easy to loop into and from during Cross Combos though the lengthy start-up reduces the number of loops that can be done, especially if the Cross Gauge wasn't full at the beginning of said Cross Combo.\n",

Takes 25 frames (plus a few frames of hitstop on hit or block) before the second attack occurs, making it a very reactable overhead and one that can only be followed up by using an assist. Still sees some use in triple overhead mix-ups after j.2BB.\n",

This is outright the single best tool to spend meter on as it resets pressure, enables free mix-ups, creates sandwich situations, shields Jin from projectiles, and can extend combos. Can be placed in a variety of different positions which can all control space on the screen. On the ground, it forces jumps, denies any lunging attacks or ground dashes, and eats weak projectiles. In the air it can discourage aerial approaches and forces the opponent to play Jin's game of spacing and footsies. Placing it on top of downed characters results in easy oki and so can using it on incoming enemy partners after K.O.ing the point character. The possibilities are endless but Jin's meter is not so don't use this recklessly.\n",

On counterhit it combos directly into 5B which is important for DPs with quick recovery. Combos directly into 2B on Tager and Blizttank (standing-only).\n\n5AA is autocombo filler. Combos directly into 2B on Tager, Hakumen and Blizttank (standing-only).\n\n5AAA is a natural frametrap which beats opponents mashing quick attacks but loses to DPs and Distortions. Therefore if you want to stay safe you have to end her autocombo before this move. Otherwise it can be used to reset pressure against defensive players or to active-switch into your partner.\n\nOn an already airborne opponent (e.g. from throws, assists, 214A, etc.) this can combo a jump-canceled j.B which can be again be looped into 5AA allowing for big damage. Combos directly into 2B on Tager and Blizttank (standing-only).\n\n5AAAA is your auto combo ender. Counts as a special and cannot be canceled into distortion drives outside of resonance blaze. Pressing 5A during it enters Cross-Raid if the partner is in correct state.\n",

This allows Rachel to use it as a counter poke to pokes with hurtboxes that extend forward a good amount. \n\nSimilar to 5A, 5AA is jump cancelable and is another good opportunity to go for an instant overhead j.A mixup. \n\nOutside of this, 5AA is mostly used in combos. However, it should be noted that at 5A's maximum spacing, 5AA will whiff. In these cases, you should cancel into 5B instead to avoid dropping the combo.\n\n5AA also vacuums the opponent towards you, allowing you to pull them out of the corner to cross up.\n\nCurrently, the unwinded version of 5AAA doesn't see too much use outside of doing the A smart combo. If you apply a 6 wind to it, it can be great for corner, especially if you extend the combo with an assist afterwards. It's important to note this attack lasts as long as Rachel is in the air or A is hit again, meaning if you wind her in an upward direction, the hitbox will remain active until she touches the ground.\n\nMostly only used in the A smart combo. Requires assist to combo after, even at greater heights.\n",

You can OTG opponents after hitting them from a low height which can reward a full combo, though the timing is a bit tricky. When combined with an assist, Agito can make for a pretty useful cross-up.\n\nHakumen recovers very quickly after this move, allowing you to do more air moves if done from normal jump height or higher. This can be useful for delaying your fall slightly to avoid an anti-air attack. Another use of the recovery is for safejump setups, as an Agito ender from a certain height will allow you to airdash before landing and fall towards your opponent. (It is recommended to use the mapped airdash button for this as it can track the opponents position, allowing you to catch back techs as well.)\n",

Azrael's 236B+C, Hyde's 214B+C). Yukikaze can be used along with an assist call to counter an incoming character after a KO.  However, if the opponent activates Resonance Blaze on time or uses their reversal, Hakumen will simply phase through them and become helpless to pressure. If the attack whiffs, Hakumen is completely invulnerable until he can block, but he will be extremely minus. This counter should be avoided if used carelessly since it has lots of recovery if not activated. Keep in mind that while the strike is unblockable, the opponent can manage to jump or reversal out in a few cases, meaning that Yukikaze may not always be the best answer.\nDoes less damage on catching a projectile since the opponent isn't in Counter Hit state (unless they're mashing).\n",

Can be confirmed into a full combo by jump cancelling any of the hits of this string (other than the last hit) and continuing with j.B. Note that while this is a good anti air against jumping opponents, it is less effective against instant air dash approaches. 4A is better suited for that.\n\nLike all Nu-13's drive normals, there is a dead zone in front of her where the move has no hitbox. If the opponent is too close to anti air with 2B, 4A or Supra Rage (A+D) should be used instead.\n\nIf close enough to the opponent, it is possible to combo 2BBBB into 5C, which allows for a safe jump with j.A. If the combo is heavily scaled, this may be a better option than attempting a longer combo.\n\nFinal hit knocks the opponent away, allowing Nu to continue zoning. While it's generally better to jump cancel before the final hit of the string for a more damaging combo and a better setup, there are times where 2B hits an opponent who is both very high and very far away. In these cases it is not always possible to jump cancel and combo into j.B, so finishing the string is the best option.\n",

Experiment with cancels into Act Parser in training mode to get a sense of the spacing.\n\nWhen combined with an assist, cancels into Act Parser can be useful for mixups. It can be used to set up left/right mixups by having the assist hit just before or just after Nu switches sides, or simply to safely get close enough for a high/low mixup with jC or 2A/2C. \n\nNote that all cancels into this version of Act Parser are negative on block, so without the aid of an assist Nu can't use Act Parser to get a guaranteed mixup (although sometimes you can catch people sleeping and cancel a random 5B into Act Parser then throw). The one exception to this is an anti air normal (usually 2B or its followups) cancelled into forward Act Parser; in this scenario, even though the opponent recovers before you, they may not be able to land and press a fast grounded normal faster than Nu-13 can press 5A.\n\nSince Nu is airborne after this move, she can follow it up with air moves such as j.B. Note that there is no true blockstring into backwards Act Parser into any normal, so be careful of characters who can use a reversal to punish the gap in blockstun.\n\nThis counts as Nu-13's air action, so it cannot be performed if she has already done a double jump or air dash.\n",

Outside of resonance there are no true blockstrings into Legacy Edge so the opponent can always input their own super post flash. In resonance, however, any version of Sickle Storm can be cancelled into Legacy Edge, which IS a true blockstring if input correctly. This allows the Nu-13 player to do true blockstrings using as many Legacy Edges as they can afford.

Confirming off from 5AA>2C>236+BC in corner and ending it with 2C>214+BC, as an example, nets you with at least 10k damage.\n\nIf you have enough bars, then at the end of the combo, you can do (2C > (some special) > Jayoku)*n > Mizuchi, creating a Hazama Airline, which will only let you go when you're dead.\n",

It already has decent range on its own but combine the fact that it moves you forward with the momentum of a dash and this button will hit further than it looks at first glance. In pressure, you can also aim to frame trap with this by delay canceling into it from 2A stagger pressure. Because it moves Makoto forward, it's best to do this when you are starting to get pushed out further from 2A range when an opponent will most expect an attempt to reset pressure and try to mash or jump out. \n\nJust to note, this move is great but it's not a disjointed hitbox so be careful when using it.\n\n5AA is mostly used to confirm 5A pokes or frame traps. You can use the jump cancellable property to bait supers, run the 214B+4P mix that will hit downbacking opponent, jump cancel IAD over, 2B... Stop cancelling into 5B from 5AA, to jump cancel out of your string and be safe, jump cancel with 5AA instead of believing you are pre-patch 1.5.\n\nBy the time you use 5AAA, you should have hitconfirm into 5AAA236[A] > 5A... or 5AAA214AAA > assist. The same options of mix as 5AA string are available (jump cancel, 214A...).\n\nYou can also use 5AAAA as a combo ender in the corner. You'll get less damage than doing an air route but you'll also be able to more comfortably handle forward techs. \n\nIt is a frametrap on block (when charged), the reward being the best starter move of Makoto with almost no scaling. She has very VERY spooky damage if you manage to pick up the opponent with a damaging assist like Yang semblance 6P.\n",

You convert from this button with 5BBB air combo, 5BB comet. Another route is 5BB > 214AAB , 5AAA... but it requires that the opponent is not grounded (e.g.: with 5B anti-air) because 5BB > 214AAB , 5A doesn't work on grounded opponent.\n\nThis button has a lot of recovery on whiff and the opponent will bait you in using it on block and punish you for it with pushblock into buttons.\n\n5B has a great stagger window to cancel into 5BB on block, making it an ok active switch button for a left-right mixup: 5B~B+D where 5BB is delayed so there's a gap so the crossup protection doesn't kick in because 5B~B is not a true blockstring. Then the opponent has to actually switch guard direction to block it,\n\nThis can reverse beat into 5A.\n\nFiew notes for comboing with 5BB: the downward hitting strike makes it possible to combo into Infinite Rush and it's followups. If you're comboing into this from linking 5B on an airborne opponent, make sure you stagger the hits so the opponent is lower to the ground or else 5BB will whiff and they'll drop out of the combo. \n\n5BB+D has good blockstun to active switch out of. You can even active switch out of it and let the partner do a fast low while keeping \"5BB+D , fast low\" a true blockstring.\n\nOpt for the full 5BBB if you want to BnB.\n\nYou could think of 236C for a stupid frametrap but you are getting pushblocked before getting to this move.\n",

Why? Because you delay the follow-up since you have a window to perfom the follow-up.\nThe oki you get from this is that you reach the ground at the same time as the opponent perfoms an automatic ground tech, which gives you the opportunity to run forward and meaty with 5A on opponent back tech, or backdash and still get meaty 5A or throw (even on 5f mash!) on opponent forward tech.

Some people tend to auto-pilot IAD + air normals so when they crash into the orb, it must feel pretty tilting that you didn't need to react with an AA and convert with 5A.\n\nAt the same time, the multiple projectile hits are good for negating lower level projectiles and protecting Makoto and can force the not full fledged space control characters to have to approach Makoto instead of trying to keep your out. \n\nIn some match-ups like Mitsuru, don't even think of using it if their 236 special outranges it.\n\nThe orb durability is not enough in some matchups, e.g.: Naoto 236A beats it\n\nNote: you can leave comet off stage (pretty useless) (proof)\n",

These are really good for multiple reasons. In neutral, the multiple hits are very good for either confirming into a combo or locking down an opponent so you can dash up and starter pressure, especially when used in combination with tactics your point character can use. \n\nIn pressure, the multiple hits are useful for locking down an opponent to allow you to go for one good mixup. Because Makoto moves forward such a great distance during the skill, it's both resilient against pushblock and good for keeping an opponent locked down so you can dash back in after being pushblocked out. Unlike other lockdown assists like Jin 6P or Chie and Kanji's 4P, it doesn't pushback the opponent when they pushblock it midscreen either so it's pretty useful anywhere on the screen for your pressure. \n\nIt's also nice for combos since the final punch of Infinite Rush is untechable until the opponent touches ground. Combined with the multiple hits, you'll have plenty of time to follow up your combo with whatever you desire. However, it only hits closer to the ground so keep that in mind.

The assist+reversal tactic was nerfed in BBTAG v1.5, where if an assist is entering the battle, a reversal will lose its reversal properties and become a normal attack, except that being hit after using it will still lock her out of bursting. Mai can still make use of this with assists that have longer startup, such as Yumi 6P or Waldstein 6P, to avoid this penalty. Certain assists can also set up a sandwich against your opponent if blocked if they last long enough to leave Mai plus on block after her DP, such as Vatista 5P \u2014 if done close to the opponent, Mai will crossup, a very useful situation in a blockstring as losing the DP properties won\u2019t matter in those situations. Can also be used at the end of combos in the corner such as relaunch 2A 5A 2B A+D to set up a safejump, as hitting your opponent when they are higher in the air gives Mai more frame advantage compared to hitting a grounded opponent.\n",

All four Shiranui forms have different movement patterns and recover in mid-air, and can allow for solo 5A conversions after landing if spaced properly.\n\nj.236B and j.214B, in particular, have similar-looking movement patterns, but there exists a spacing where j.236B hits sameside while j.214B hits crossup. Jubei recovers behind the opponent if they block, which also allows you to set up cross combo assist sandwiches. You can also fake a j.214B crossup by active switching to an on-screen assist just before j.214B hits, but the conversion off that can be difficult or impossible for a lot of characters.\n",

Jump towards opponents for a high/low mix-up by utilizing either j.A or empty jump-in 2A if the opponent is respecting Yu's offense. Jump away to disengage and return to neutral.\n\nIzanagi quickly charges forward, dragging his sword along the ground for one hit then thrusting forward for a second hit. Fantastic in blockstrings as Izanagi is unaffected by Reject Guards and will reach the opponent even if 5A was blocked at max range. 5AA's speed allows it to combo after 5A even if it hit at max range. The 1st hit may whiff against airborne opponents, but the 2nd hit will catch them.\n\nKnocks aerial opponents into the ground. Can true blockstring into 5B even if it is Reject Guarded. Gives Yu a guaranteed safe-jump set-up by forward jump canceling, doing a delayed air dash, and attacking with j.A. This works against forward, back, and neutral tech so long as Yu isn't too close or too far from the opponent when 5AAA connects.\n\n5AAAA is unsafe on block. The high hitstun of 4AAA along with its knock down and jump cancelable properties means that Yu always has better options for more damage, meter gain, and Oki. Only use it if you have hitstun to spare and an assist available for combo extension.\n\nswords have feelings too\n\n5AA, 1st hit\n\n5AA, 2nd hit\n\n5AAA\n",

It is used in combos to bring airborne opponents to the ground to end them with Swift Strike or Cross Slash, providing both fantastic corner carry and oki. Using EX Zio after Raging Lion puts opponents into the corner allows Yu to act freely as Izanagi covers all possible tech options, making it easy for Yu to shut down any wake-up attacks. However, it is difficult to use this move as a mix-up tool if assists are unavailable, as Raging Lion is very unsafe on block. Note that the 16 frame start-up is misleading for ground blockstrings as it doesn't account for a jump's start-up frames.\n\nExpand for j.C Height Diagram\n\n\n",

Effective poke against opponents who lack the tools or resources to evade or blow through projectiles. Be careful as there are projectile invincible attacks and multi-hit projectiles that can punish this attack, including most supers. In combos, Yu can use this against airborne opponents to bring them lower to the ground and into his 5A, though they must be as high as possible when they are hit by the grounded Light Zio. The window to link Light Zio to 5A is incredibly small and can only be achieved through both tight execution and an assist, making it more trouble than it is worth.\n\nB / Heavy Version:\n\nThis version doesn't see much use during neutral, but is valuable in combos where neither Swift Strike or a super would be viable. Knocks down standing opponents while bringing airborne opponents back down to the ground. The long recovery makes it difficult for Yu to continue his pressure safely, though assists can mitigate the risks.\n\nThe air version of Zio has endlag that lasts until reaching the ground on top of having additional landing lag. Note that Izanagi is placed where Yu launches Zio. Additional uses of Zio will be fired from that spot until Izanagi returns, gets hit, Yu recalls Izanagi by using a move that requires him, or if Yu gets hit.\n\nA / Light Version:\n\nUsed often after an IABD right before touching the ground to zone out opponents while retreating. By placing Izanagi slightly off the ground, following Zios can deny both dashes and IAD's, forcing opponents to either retreat or jump-in from higher up which sets Yu up for easy anti-airs. Also used in Resonance Blaze combos right before using Ziodyne in air combos.\n\nB / Heavy Version:\n\nSlow to start and end with little reward for a successful hit. Shouldn't be used other than to punish hilariously slow air actions by your opponents.\n",

By the time the super's animation is over, Yu will barely have enough time for 2B into either Big Gamble or another Cross Slash. A short air combo can be done but only if the super landed really early on. It's still a valid option to keep in mind, but not something that should be relied upon: Yu can easily deal much higher damage and use less meter by utilizing more practical combo routes.\n\nWhile the enhanced version can also be followed-up, the longer animation eats up more of the combo timer. Because of this, the potential to followup is weaker than the base version. However, the extra meter from Resonance Blaze makes it easy to follow-up with a 2B into another Cross Slash. This technique can earn clutch wins if used capitalized on correctly, but it's still not something that should be relied upon much.\n\nA hitbox fit for a king(pin).\n",

Now instead of a combo tool, it's a pressure tool that sets up a gapless high/low mix up and can also be used in neutral to great effect. The move has long start up but you recover before the active frames end! An example block string to set up this mix up point would be 5AA > jump cancel > j.C. If the opponent did not anti air your jump cancel they will be blocking j.C while you're falling to the ground, this gives you the option to either fall down and hit them low with 2A or air dash towards them right before landing and hit them high with j.A. As the move is active after you recover, it's possible to use it in neutral as a sort of wall. Beware though, as Tomoe can still get persona broken and so it is possible for your opponent to force their way through your Tomoe barrier.\n",

It nullifies all projectile attacks and briefly physical attacks (startup only) before knocking the opponent back and granting Yukiko substantial healing time. Dia itself does find use as a tool that can rewards Yukiko after a knockdown, if her opponent is far away, or if they're unable to close in on her right away. Can also be used offensively as a combo ender, disrupt Cross Bursts, and even denies DHCs (UNLESS the DHC is not a projectile, in which case Yukiko WILL be punished). Depending on the right partner (i.e. Waldstein, Hyde), Yukiko can nearly fully heal herself during a match!\nWhen covered by an assist, particularly projectiles, Yukiko can safely tap Dia. The further she is from the opponent and the more cautious the opponent is can determine how long she can reasonably hold for. Utilizing Reject Guard in combination with an immediate assist call can be a decent way to find room to use Dia.\nDia's projectile invulnerability allows Yukiko to be something of an anti-zoning zoner, as she can avoid any (and every) projectile while healing at the same time.\nTake care when using this, as Yukiko can get punished while she's recovering. A simple tap leaves little room for worry, but if held down for too long and the opponent recovers fast enough, Yukiko is left wide open. Make sure you're on the same footing as your opponent when considering this move, if not faster yourself. \nFinally, because Yukiko levitates during the state, she cannot be thrown or command grabbed out of it. \n",

Damages scales slightly if used in a combo, and on a raw hit it deals massive damage (especially on Lv.9). Excellent at catching Cross Bursts, moves with long reach and moves in recovery state, regardless of duration. Becomes increasingly threatening with each fire level stocked; on a raw hit, Lv.0 does 4.5k dmg, while Lv.9 does around 10k alone! Offers a ridiculous amount of chip damage during Resonance Blaze, but leaves Yukiko wide open, so be mindful of the distance between you and the enemy and see to it they don't have a means to punish from said distance.\n\nIt is recommended that a Yukiko player spends time learning every other characters' blockstring consistently and thoroughly, so that they'll have a better awareness of when to use this move; Agidyne can be a highly rewarding, yet highly risky move (outside of comboing, of course).\n\nDepending on the partner, an early DHC will allow the partner (examples are Weiss, Nine, Aegis etc.) to follow-up while Agidyne is still in motion.\n\nAn interesting thing to note is that Agidyne completely beats Tager's 5B in every regard, even if he holds it to max length.\n",

A perfectly timed charge will result in a huge improvement in damage, scaling, and hitstun, opening up new combo routes. Note that this move will not naturally combo off of most A or B starters, even with counterhits outside of j.C.\n\nWhile 5B appears to have extreme range, it's arc is deceiving as it does not reach nearly as high and slightly as far as the animation implies. If this move hits at max range 5BB will whiff, requiring either a preemptive assist call or a fast move with long reach like 2C or 236C to continue into a combo. Be careful when using this attack as a poking tool.\n\n5BB drags opponents closer to Kanji to extend combos or apply pressure. For combos, the suction is important for solo routes as it allows 2B to be used as a combo part as 2B tends to miss due to its short horizontal range. For pressure, the strong pull-in after his longest range normals helps Kanji overcome his poor mobility by bringing opponents to him. Thanks to this attack's being only -1 on block, Kanji can use the threat of gatlings or special-cancels to scare the opponent into letting him reset pressure, creating a good opportunity to utilize his command grabs to pierce the opponent's defense.\n",

This makes his DP's hitbox fairly flexible so long as the opponent commits to a non-projectile option. It's also a relatively good anti-air as it beats opponents trying to use jump-ins, cross-ups, or empty-jump lows or throws. Both the raw attack and the counter version are air unblockable as well. If this move counter hits an opponent at its max vertical height or the opponent triggers the counter at a high enough elevation, Kanji can convert the hit into 4A for a full combo. Wary opponents can bait out this move and punish the recovery by out-spacing or by guarding on the ground so use it carefully.\n",

The enhanced version has Take-Mikazuchi follow up the sequence by stabbing the opponent with his lightning spear before calling down 5 bolts of electricity. This is Kanji's main ender for high damage combos as it is his only super that can be used mid-combo. Provides very basic oki on hit, only enough for a meaty with 5A or 5B. As a reversal, it is both fast and surprisingly safe thanks to the chair's second hit covering Kanji's recovery. To punish this move, opponents must either use moves with projectile or full invincibility or attacks that push Kanji and themselves out of the chair's collision course. The infinite hits on the projectile can be used to blow through zoning and reclaim control of the neutral though at the cost of two bars and low damage on hit. Depending on the partner choice, a preemptive assist call can lead into a conversion off a successful projectile hit.\n",

It is also a strong option on defense as it's a fully invincible reversal that invalidates safe-jumps thanks to its throw properties. After the 6 frames of start-up (and the additional 2 frames if the opponent isn't within immediate grab range) and the super freeze occurs, the move has zero frames of further start-up so if the opponent is in throw range they cannot do anything to avoid it.

Quite the recovery, but if your high enough in the air you can recover midair, avoiding the landing recovery. Where 214B really shines in is combos, as if you cross over your opponent in air you can hit them with Kintoki-Douji's whirling arm into j.A, allowing you to continue your combo while also getting items in play.

The warp is very fast, and Teddies hitbox is active as soon as he pops out of the TV, making for a very ambiguous left/right mix. Very risky to do raw as both warps lose to jumping on reaction, but if you hard-callout a projectile you can punish with this.\n",

Learn how to set up A and B traps in the air to control space while keeping yourself safe.\n\nThe B version of this move only covers the ground. In combos its a bit harder to use properly since the trap has to fall to the ground and then it starts setting up. Its plus on block but you need to be very close to your opponent and its easy to react to. You can be a bit tricky with this version in the air for some left/right mixups.\n",

Knowing when you want to mark your opponent and when you are better off keeping the pressure is an important skill to have for this character. Also take into account that you need 4 meter to kill someone by just using the Fate Mark mechanic. If you manage to get a happy birthday, you can(and probably should) mark both characters at the same time. In the corner you can get oki by calling an assist before the shotgun hits your opponent, this works with all the cast.\n",

This will use your 2nd jump however, so be wary when throwing it out.\n\nUnburstable attack, but followups after it are quite limited. With good timing, it's possible to follow up with Heat Riser anywhere, regardless of combo timer decay. If hitstun hasn't detoriated too much, assists can be used during or after Heat Riser in the corner to follow-up (or midscreen with a wide hitting assist such as Elizabeth's 6P) but otherwise this move sees little late-combo usage.\n\nIf you're close to the corner, you can link this into Demonic Cross Slash. Atom Smasher is doable as well, but it's harder, though it can be done anywhere on the screen to compensate (after the first hit and with not too high hitstun decay). It's also special-cancellable into Maziodyne (air version), but that doesn't lead to much damage and allows the opponent to airtech.\n\nBecomes much more threatening (espicially against air approaches) when used in Resonance, however, as it will allow confirming Heat Riser into Atom Smasher or even IK in LVL4 Blaze.\n",

If the opponent is high enough and Hyde is low to the ground when using this move, Hyde has enough of a frame advantage to either pick opponents with 5A for a combo extension or to preform safe-jump oki.

A successful hit always corners the opponent and grants Hyde safe-jump oki making this his most powerful combo ender, one which should be used whenever possible.

Can be used as a reversal though it is horribly unsafe on block so use this wisely.\n",

Mostly combo filler.\n\n5AAAA is a Combo ender for restoring health. Gives decent oki as IAD j.A immediately after will safejump the opponent's tech in any direction.\n\nIt is possible to Active Switch to another character during this grab by calling an assist during the 5A string and inputting D during the startup of the hitgrab, but before it actually connects. This allows you to regain a chunk of health and switch Carmine out to allow him to regenerate even more health, while retaining okizeme options.\n\nAs of 2.0, you can perform a cross raid from this ender, which ensures the opponent doesn't swap sides with you meanwhile you still retain healing properties.\n",

If set up properly, 236x can catch all air techs and can be used in unblockable setups with reversal action. Can be used in combos after throw after a dissolve is nearby or can otherwise be combo'd off most confirms with assists.\n\nHis B versions of his spin are a new asset to him in this game and are pretty useful for further ranged space control and setting far dissolves.

While Aim Opening has a deceptively large hitbox, it isn't very good as an anti-air as it doesn't reach very high vertically and even if it does catch an opponent he will need a very slow assist that can pick them up after Gordeau does both Aim Opening and Precise Aim. Not usually used in ground combos due to this move's poor oki options but this is his only choice for ending air combos.

Each shot will attempt to track the point character independently of where the previous shot traveled. Used in blockstrings and in neutral to pin down the opponent with or without an assist. If the first or second arrow catches the opponent blocking in mid-air near the orb, the following shots can keep them airborne long enough for Seth to react with Acute Ambush for an unblockable set-up. Can lead into a full combo even without a preemptive assist call if the opponent was in the corner. Not very useful in combos as it has the same damage per shot as the normal version while eating more combo time, usually resulting in one less loop and ultimately less damage.\n",

In exchange, this is one of the easier reversals to extend via preemptive assist calls due to the lower than average endlag and high hitstun. Very unsafe on block so don't use this carelessly. The height the opponent was at when they get hit by the final hit alters this move's frame advantage. Against grounded opponents the oki provided is very basic, but at max height Ruby can perform a safe-jump set-up.  Cannot be used in mid-air, meaning Ruby has no invulnerable options while in the air.\n",

Great for Active Switchs as the partner character can move in under the cover of the shots or confirm into a combo from if Ruby successfully hit the opponent.

One thing to note is that because it launches the opponent relatively low, it is better to start the air combo with j.B than j.A, as starting with j.A can potentially whiff due to it's hitbox.

The armor on 5B only applies to body-attribute attacks however, so it's ineffective against most of the lows and overheads in the game. \n\nYang's main options from 5B when connecting with the opponent are essentially 5BB, 2C, 214A, 214B, 236X, and jump-cancel, making it a key branching point for a lot of her offense.\n\nSince the vast majority of the Reversal Actions in the game have body-attribute, Yang has the potential to safely plow through such reversal options. However, as the armor on 5B does not come out frame 1 and the startup and active frames of Reversal Actions generally come fairly late, 5B cannot be used as a meaty when attempting to beat Reversal Actions, nor to directly challenge them. A certain delayed timing is thus required to manage Reversal Actions after knockdown, but with this delayed timing the opponent has the potential to counterhit or throw Yang before 5B can come out.\n\n5B has the potential to armor through various Distortion Skills, but this is much more limited. Certain Distortion Skills, such as Gordeau's 236BC, have enough startup after the superflash that Yang can 5B on reaction. However, the faster startup of most body-attribute Distortion Skills do not offer Yang this luxury. As a result, unless 5B was already started before a Distortion Skill, which is essentially uncontrollable, it is not very likely to go through one.\n\n5BB is mostly combo and potentially pressure filler. Because of Yang's average run speed and general lacking range, she will often whiff 5BB at 5B's max-range leaving her open to being punished. As a result, caution must be exercised with 5BB, making sure to both cancel into it at appropriate ranges, and cancel out of it if blocked.\n\nIf armoring through something with greater active frames and invuln than 5B, continuing into 5BB provides further invuln that generally takes care of the rest. \n\nWhile auto-piloting into 5BB is not advised since it can be punished if whiffed or push-blocked, when 5B armors through an attack, there is a very slight pause, with this pause being repeated for multi-hit attacks. If wary of this pause, it can be used as a way to be sure 5B's armor is active and confirm into 5BB.\n",

This is particularly strong against opponents that disrespect 2A's range or cannot react with appropriate lows.\n\nIf within range, 2A can be canceled into 5AA, which allows her to cancel back into 2A and then another 5A cancel, allowing her to greatly extend her normally relatively short pressure.

Hooray!\n\nWhile j.BB's hitbox is fairly lacking, it does its job as a quick aerial to follow j.B with. This mostly comes into play canceling into it off of IAD j.B, as j.A's slightly higher startup causes it to not come out if the j.B is slightly delayed and generally requires more immediate timing. \n\nIt can be okay as air blockstring filler, but j.A can then be gone into instead, and j.A's hitbox is simply better. As a result, there's not much reason for this outside of fairly niche cases or combo filler.\n\nWhile its damage is essentially the same as other air combo options, because both j.B and j.BB utilize Yang's gauntlet, both hits benefit from Semblance's damage boost. Assuming the faster startup and better hitbox of j.A is not needed, j.BB then becomes optimal when taking to the air.\n",

Similar to pressure situations, calling an assist will allow Yang to combo after a successful hit, and keep her safe in case the j.C is blocked.\n\nOn defense, the normal is also decent enough to Fuzzy j.C with (17BC1) to steal your turn, granted you get a good read on when there's a gap in your opponent's pressure/your opponent will try to grab you.\n",

As most 5As and 2As are too short to reach her, 5B has enough time to obtain its body-invuln for longer-reaching, slower normals. Wise opponents watching out for 236A reset can beat out the 5B easily with just about any 2C however.\n\nIf Reject Guarded, it will not reach the opponent due to the greatly increased distance. Its lingering hitbox can catch opponents attempting to move forward after, but this still leaves a large gap that can be punished by Distortion Skills and other options.\n\nIf 236X is desired for zoning on the ground, 236B is practically better than 236A in every way as its arc extends 2/3 the screen horizontally. It's slightly more negative than 236A on block so should be exclusively for zoning.\n",

On counter hit, Burst of Embers is +6, allowing you to convert into a combo by linking into 5A. Burst of Embers is -1 on regular hit and -4 on block, so you give up any further pressure in most cases unless you perform one of its followups or you're covered by an assist call. Since Burst of Embers does not have armor against foot or head attribute attacks, it should also not be thrown out haphazardly or during situations where you could easily be hit during the startup. \n",

                        "Description": "With its invulnerability and extreme speed, Burning Gold is a very threatening option open to wary players. So long as the opponent isn't grounded or not too high in the air, it can be used before and after most Distortion Skills and come out on top. \n\nSimilarly, it can even be used on reaction to punish high recovery projectiles such as Vatista's and Naoto's 236A even after blockstun, but the timing for this is strict and not for the faint of heart. Conversely, it also works well against high startup projectiles such as Jin's 236B or Vatista's 214C/j.214C, though with good reactions even faster projectiles can be punished. Certain options like Aigis's 236X which inflict a high amount of blockstun and have low recovery after can be punished by canceling blockstun with Reject Guard.\n\nWhen being pressured, Reject Guard into Burning Gold can be a costly though highly rewarding and threatening option. It forces the opponent to stray away from predictable and/or high recovery pressure options which for most characters tends to be their 5AAA and/or 5BB. While this is less effective against players/characters that do not commit to such options, against those that do it is a serious threat that the opponent must learn to respect. Wary opponents may stagger their pressure with normals that have low recovery and blockstun to both avoid Reject Guard as well as large gaps that can be punished by Reject Guard. Even more wary opponents can cancel into their own Distortion Skills or Reversal Actions in reaction to Burning Gold's superflash assuming they have sufficient invuln and have not special-canceled into something.\n\nBeing wary of when Yang enters Semblance is very important since it provides a brief pause to examine the opponent as soon as she is grounded and in neutral. If the opponent commits to either a high startup or high recovery option, the pause Semblance offers provides enough time to safely \"punish\" with Burning Gold or Reversal Action, since both are frame 1 invuln and quickly active. While the timing is relatively strict since poor timing will have Yang stuffed by an opponent's active frames, getting it down and recognizing when the opponent has committed too hard is important for punishing opponents that do not respect Semblance's activation.\n\nFor all Burning Gold's strengths, it is not entirely better than Unrelenting Fire (214B+C). First, its invuln can lose to Distortion Skills and Reversal Actions with higher invuln. Second, it does leave Yang point-blank to the opponent when blocked, so if Yang's partner is available, be prepared to Distortion Skill Duo or Cross Burst (and avoid predictable timing) if using it riskily.\n",

The slight forward movement at the beginning of the move allows for ambiguous cross-ups so it also enables left/right mix-ups. However, this move cannot be canceled into anything else even if Akatsuki is in Resonance Blaze which means that a preemptive assist call is the only way to extend combos. First hit occurs while he falls and the second occurs once he lands. The second hit is what keeps him safe on block and guarantees safe-jump oki on hit, thus cross-ups with this move are always punishable on block as the second hit will whiff. Calling an assist as Akatsuki crosses-up keeps him safe and creates a sandwich situation if Cross Combo is used.\n",

Freezes opponents and destroys projectiles that hit the parry, preventing them from escaping the counter punch or putting Akatsuki at a frame advantage though note that opponents get the same cancel options as they would have on block. Can be used back-to-back to counter multi-hit moves, though only if the counter-attack doesn't occur. Canceling into a super will make the invul from the parry gapless, useful for punishing long range attacks with Kamikaze or slow attacks with Thunderbolt for a full combo. Parry will always fail if used too soon after an assist call, meaning only partners with very slow assists can be used to combo after the counter punch. Contrary to the animation, this move protects Akatsuki from both sides.\n\nThe aerial version maintains aerial momentum and cannot do anything else until Akatsuki reaches the ground. If he lands before the recovery ends, he will transition into the ground version.\n\nAutomatic counter attack. A punch with low range and no cancel options. Is safe on block and is also air unblockable but seeing as this attack only occurs if it is guaranteed to hit, neither situation should occur. Will auto correct to hit opponents behind Akatsuki. Can only combo after this move by using certain assists.\n\nAn important change from UNIST is that if the criteria for the retaliatory attack are met, Akatsuki MUST attack. This means that this move will always lose to attacks that have enough invul frames and either recover before Akatsuki does or the active frames last past his invul frames, such as Merkava's I, Resentfully Rage super.\n\nThe aerial version is air blockable, but as it only occurs if it would hit this doesn't amount to anything. \n",

It hits anyone right roughly in front of Blitz.\n\n236B is the go-to space control laser for Blitztank. It hits the entire screen in length at a relative shallow angle, ending slightly above the corner on the other side. Snipe the opponent for doing something, hit the assist, you name it.\n\nDo keep in mind that it has a decent amount of recovery, and thanks to Blitz height, making it weak to IADs.\n\n236C is the Anti-Air laser. It goes straight forward the entire screen, completely missing the entire cast except for standing Tager, Merkava, and an opponent Blitztank. It acts as his best option to stop anyone from trying to jump too much at long ranges.\n\nThis laser also has the least amount of recovery, making it crucial for combos and conversions. From mid to full screen, you can tack on a bit extra with a second laser or 236BC. Close range, a Ansturm will hit nicely. In the corner, however, it's the second vital part of his corner loops, making 5BB 236C loop into itself for at least 6 times with a 5B starter. Unlike most C moves, it does not cost meter\n\nThe air versions are mostly the same with varying angles, but the most important feature is that the recovery of air lasers is cut short when landing, making them potentially much safer on block to the point of possibly being + on block, AND making combos after them possible. A quick TK air Laser can be up to +3 on block, while a fully delayed air laser can be up to +8 on block. A very key part in Blitztank zoning, as he can keep the pressure going and stop other characters from retaliating.\n\nDelayed laser after j.B is needed to get combos afterwards\n",

However, for how good it is, it also comes with some issues. It has no invulnerability, with the exception being the first frame during the super flash. It's unsafe on block, but depending on the distance to the opponent that might be hard for them to take advantage of. But anyone with their own full screen option will be able to readily punish it. On top of that, it actually has less minimum damage than Blitzlauf, however in situations where that matters only really come up in very long and highly prorated combos.  \n\nDue to lasting a fairly long time, some fast DSD follow-ups allow for further combos afterwards, letting certain teams get high damage from long range snipes and confirms.\n\nWhat else did you expect really?\n",
