The damage is affected by Guts, but is not considered chip damage so if you don't have enough HP to take the attack you will still die. Even if the Counter does not come out on a successful parry, Charlotta is still invulnerable for the rest of the duration and +39 as the opponent is staggered.\nCounter: If the opponent is close enough when their move is parried, a Counter slash automatically activates for damage, a side switch, and a hard knockdown. If the opponent had a normal move parried, they cannot cancel it with anything to retaliate.\n5U is a fairly reliable anti-air option, as it will trigger even against jump normals from far above you.  However, its horizontal activation range is poor.  Regardless, the move can still be used to counter fireballs, as they will activate the Counter If you're close enough.",

Can be useful for some abare situations.\nDeceptively good range, despite the somewhat stubby looking animation.\nDjeeta's best normal for checking Cross Overs, with 2U being the next strongest.\nLinks into itself on counter hit. Highly useful when checking Cross Overs, as these are counter hit state on recovery.\nLinks into f.M on crouching counter hit. This situation will occur more frequently than you might think.\nCombos into L and H Vorpal Blade on normal hit, and M Vorpal Blade on crouching or counter hit. Like with f.M and f.H, cancels into M Vorpal Blade on block will frametrap, at the risk of your cancel being dodged.",

Excellent for dealing with crossups.\nCan be stuffed by some early jump normals, or very close range jumps. For these angles, c.H or Rising Sword can be better anti-airs.\nCombos into 5U or Rising Sword on normal hit.\nCounter hit conversions can be awkward. Juggles into f.M, f.H, or c.H depending on the height and distance the opponent was hit. You'll have to judge the situation on reaction based on where your opponent is.\nNo conversions that work consistently on normal and counter hit, forcing Djeeta to confirm normal vs counter hit to optimize her anti-air damage.",

However, if this does move hit close to the opponent's feet, it's possible to be safe, or even plus. \nThe angle the move goes in can be altered by inputting j.4U or j.6U, for a total of 3 different angles. When cornered, you can jump and input j.6U as a way to escape out (however, the opponent can smack you for this if they read it). In Liechten, you can use j.4U to convert off of instant overhead j.L.  You can also use j.4/5/6U as a way to set up pressure and high/low mix on opponents in Liechten.",

Each hit of an autocombo contributes to this 3-move limit. Hinrichten allows you to do a multitude of things, such as reverse beat your pokes into 2L to cut down their recovery, convert off of rising j.L instant overhead without a setup prior, and combo into 2U naturally for a hard knockdown. DOES NOT HAVE INVINCIBILITY FRAME 1 SO DO NOT USE IT AS A REVERSAL!\nWhile in install, specials will not recharge until install finishes. Recharging specials used before install became active will have their timers paused and will resume recharging once the install is over. \nThis can also be used as a pseudo chainshift/YRC. Buffering this input in neutral while in range can be good to start pressure or catch them during fireball startup. \nThere is currently no known difference between the easy input (214S) and the hard input (214214H)",

Both share similar uses in neutral with small differences to make them cover different angles. 2M is safer on block and hit, and is one of the few moves Ladiva has that can hit Cross-Over. It's also the best option Ladiva has of hitting moves low to the ground, such as Ferry's 2M that f.M can't hit.  \nTogether with f.M makes up the bread and butter of Ladiva's neutral and poking game.",

A versatile movement tool with many applications that increase after a hard knockdown or when 236H is forcing the opponent to block, including baiting anti-airs and reversals. Altering the fastfall timing during a jump makes which side he lands on extremely ambiguous.\nQuick Stop: Used to bait whiffs in neutral when well-spaced, but the recovery can prevent you from getting a proper punish. Also used in some anti-air combo routes.\nCross Over: Can cross through opponents, but its recovery and the presence of the Guard button doesn't make it a strong mixup just by itself.\nFeint: Also used to bait moves in neutral, with less risk than quick stop. Using this to bait forward-moving reversals can reward you with a huge punish.\nJump: Same as the teleport from 22L/M. Used in safejumps after 66H knockdown. The diagonal angle makes it possible to force many wakeup DPs to whiff after a midscreen knockdown, at the risk of losing to regular anti-airs."

A popular setup used to be a low j.U, but due to the added landing recovery in 1.31 it's no longer as strong. It's also possible to do 22M, but that will lose to reversals unless you do 22[M] (which will still lose to EX reversals).\nBack Throw:\nAdvantage on hit:\nLancelot's back throw sends the opponent half screen, which is too far for 236X to work as a meaty.

Her skills deal big damage at just about any range, so give her a call when it's about time to finish off the foe. All of her attacks can be spotdodged individually or avoided. When the timer runs out Lowain has punishable recovery frames. Make sure you finish them off or you push them far enough to avoid being punished.\nSince it's a knowledge check instead of guaranteed damage, it's slightly less useful against experienced players (you still deals ridiculous chip damage) However, Lowain disappears when this move goes active. So it can be used as a very expensive get-out-of-jail-free card if you're in a pinch since it does have frame 1 invincibility. \nNote that using the easy input (236S+U) will result in 10% less damage on all moves.",

C.H can be a nice combo-filler in ground-combos(or before your air-juggle), but beware that it has a significant knock-back effect especially when the ground combo extends.\nSometimes works as an anti-air but rarely.Lacking range both horizontally and vertically, mashing this button against an air opponent is usually suicide.\nYou may have to note that unlike some games, in GBVS counterhits DO NOT carry through the move, that means you can have counterhit effect on the first c.H hit, but NOT for the second or the third c.H hit.(e.g. you can do (CH)c.H(1st)>5U>j.H, but (CH)c.H(1st,2nd or full)>5U>j.H do not work)",

If swapping to Kagura stance, a red butterfly will be shown, and if swapping to Genji stance, a blue butterfly will be shown. When done alone, the swapping has a bit of a lengthy recovery time, which is why you'll want to shorten the duration by cancelling its recovery into any move whatsoever, such as 5L. Its most important property, however, is that this can be used while you're in the middle of a move. If used in this way, as soon as Narmaya returns to neutral, she'll be in the other stance. This can be used to switch stances in neutral by whiffing a light button, and pressing U during the whiff.\nFor those familiar with Jojo:HFTF, the idea behind each stance is similar to Chaka's Stand ON/OFF. With tools such as f.M and Setsuna, Genji stance is an excellent neutral stance, whereas Kagura's moves such as Mugenkagura and Crescent moon make it an ideal stance for close ranges.",

This lets you continue with your own combo, or take time to create various mixups. Usually, this is not worth it compared to the full animation, but it can be used if you would otherwise not get a full combo at all. You will also only get the initial hit if you're too far for the full animation, especially when you use easy input",

The hurtbox is active before the hitbox is, leading to some weird-looking interactions where he gets hit by a button a screen away. It's not just when the move starts up, either. The hurtbox lingers far after it looks like it would be over, allowing for easy whiff punishes by most of the cast. To counteract these weaknesses, all you have to do is make sure it doesn't whiff.

Generally used to knock your opponent down at the end of a combo if wanting to save the H version. Can lead to meaty 22M in the corner.\nM version - Comes out the slowest, but provides the most advantage on block. Used to reset pressure on opponents scared to contest your blockstrings.\nH version - Comes out faster than the L version and provides advantage on block. The centerpiece starter for most of Soriz's high damage corner combos. On block, it can be used as a guaranteed way to reset pressure and continue your blockstring.\nAll Versions lose 100 damage when doing them with simple input, 800/1100/1000 instead of 900/1200/1100",

Attacks hitting Vaseraga while he's armored will have damage reduced by 50%.\nThe two hits of armor are activated on any of the following skills or attacks:Charged grounded H attacks. You can still use them and preserve the armor buff so long as you don't charge them.\nSoul Forge itself\nBattalions of Fear (M/H)\nSavage Rampage (including follow-up Skills and March)\nSoul Forge itself is, in fact, one of the strongest moves to use the armor buff on, as it leads to a full c.H confirm upon successful hit at close range, whether it counters or not -- not to mention it also reapplies armor immediately. It requires a counter-hit to combo on jumping confirms, but it is air unblockable. Combined with 2 hits of armor makes it a effective anti-air when 2H won't cut it.\nThe startup until Soul Forge becomes armored is 5F. This is a critical aspect of Vaseraga's matchups, because his fastest jab, 2L, is only 6F.",

The L and M versions can be followed up a single time, and all H versions can be followed up twice.Upwards followups (7X, 8X, 9X) do more damage than horizontal and downwards followups.\nA common tactic is to input 66X~6X on hit and 66X~4X on block, to gain corner carry on hit and retreat on block. This keeps Zeta relatively safe but she can be chased down by some specific specials and Skybound Arts.\nThese followups can frametrap the opponent after the initial hit, but are incredibly unsafe on block, so use this strategy with caution.\nOkizeme varies depending on the followups used. 66X~6X~6X provides the easiest safejump for pogo okizeme, even midscreen.\nThe correct sequence of followups can allow Zeta to extend her combos in the corner (or in some specific cases, midscreen), depending on the timing and the height of the opponent.

All of the followups will be enhanced when performed from the H version of Rhapsody.\nThe armor during Rhapsody allows Zeta to punish specific things that other characters can struggle to deal with, such as Percival's fireball traps.\nUnlike some other armor or parry type moves, spot dodging after your move is armored does not guarantee a punish due to the Knee Assault followup.\nThe followups can be used regardless of if Zeta armors through something, allowing them to be used in combos. Good as an alternative combo ender from a midscreen auto combo hit if Spear of Arvess is on cooldown.\nUnlike some other armored moves in the game, like Katalina's Light Wall, Zeta can actually armor multiple hits.\nNone of the followups have any invincibility or armor, so they can be baited if the opponent uses a multi-hitting move to throw off the timing of her followup, or make it impossible for her to perform one safely.",

Massive wall of moving hitbox that covers jumping opponent but rather short in range. Its initial cinematic may signals the opponent to block-punish this, so it is safer to use it as a whiff-punish move or combo ender to close out the round.",
