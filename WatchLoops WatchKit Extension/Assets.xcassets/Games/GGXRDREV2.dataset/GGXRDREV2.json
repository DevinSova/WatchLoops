It can be decent to use on 5H hit against characters that don't have great close range options, esp. on crouch confirm (crouching adds 1F of hitstun to all attacks), or to RRC into a full combo. It's a strong option simply for movement, as Answer's dash is not extraordinary, to be used at a range where the palm strike won't connect.",

Knocks down on hit, though in longer combos the opponent may be able to recover before hitting ground.\nCan be YRC'd for a great pressure and neutral tool which puts a grounded opponent in long blockstun and lets you react to opponents trying to jump over it.\nLoses to preemptive air approaches, such as IAD or certain special moves. IAD YRC is also effective against Rensen, since it slows down time to where followups don't even come out.\nThe hurtbox extends forward a little and can lose to faster moves, so don't use this move raw at close range too often.\nRensen hitting from further away gives you a better frame advantage; don't autopilot into up followup unless you want to push opponents further back.\nCancelling normals into Rensen usually leaves a gap in between; be mindful of opponents attempting reversals.\nRensen can be done out of a microdash (done by inputting [4]66S) for additional reach.\nDoesn't cause any pushback against cornered opponents, which can make a blocked Rensen dangerous if not enough distance is created."

Not as good against people who just get normal hit by mids on wakeup unless you special cancel it.Staggers on ground counterhit (Frame advantage is +8 to +22)\nStrong frametrap option vs fuzzy throw, especially against characters with slow 5H/throw OSes.\nPushes the opponent farther than it advances Baiken, so you can't constantly throw this out on a blocking opponent.\nHas a very generous special cancel window.\nThe throw OS option of choice against people mashing backthrow (or Potemkin Buster).\nThrow invulnerable on startup frames [11]",

It is also active forever which can be very useful when you are trying to beat airthrows or high-invuln backdashes.\nBecause of the high commitment nature of this move, it is best to option select forward air-throws with one of Baiken's other air buttons (usually j.P).Very good frame advantage from safejumps.\nPuts her in throw range if blocked from an IAD. This gives it good synergy with 6K and 2K (or 2D). jH 6K will beat most throw mash, and jH 2K will work if the blockstring is gapless since 2K hits low.\nUseful for beating high-invuln backdashes like Potemkin.\nBaiken dedicates herself to this pose until she hits the enemy or the ground.\nSpecial cancelleable throughout active frames. Buffering 6236 after j.H makes it easier to confirm into tatami or yozansen.\nCompleting the special cancel into air tatami on a grounded opponent is possible unless the move connects while Baiken is moving downwards.",

When used in this capacity, it is strike invulnerable for over half its duration, but can be thrown at any point in its duration. Azami Mawarikomi cannot be YRCed, but if used correctly gives Baiken enough time to sidestep and throw opponents. Also good for getting around projectiles like Venom's balls and getting out of the corner, as it allows Baiken to effectively negate the hitstop-based advantage projectiles offer.. Generally weak to YRC and is best used intermittently now that it is not her only invulnerable guard cancel option. Use to dodge big normals with bad recovery.\nAzami Mawarikomi interacts interestingly with Azami's hitstop properties, in that if activated immediately on a strike the invulnerability frames of Mawarikomi will effectively be wasted in hitstop, when Baiken was not in danger of being hit anyway. This means a fast Mawarikomi should be used with the aggressive intention to step in and throw, and delayed Mawarikomi with the intention of making a big recovery normal whiff.Azami version is strike invulnerable from frames 1-16, and cannot be YRCed.Suzuran Mawarikomi has no invulnerability but will sometimes evade slow normals. Primarily used to switch sides on okizeme, especially after Rokkonsogi knockdowns, but this sacrifices okizeme quality. Since it is possible to superjump over opponents after rokkonsogi and get a safejump mixup, Suzuran mawarikomi in this capacity is only good for when you have meter to spare for tatami yrc on okizeme, or when the spacing is too awkward for a superjump mixup.Can be YRCed.",

You use this to brute force through hitboxes, projectile-covered approches, and plenty of other unfavourable situations. With 50 Meter it can be RRC'ed on block to swing tempo, and on counter hit, it leads into monstrous damage and corner carry.  Sakura's downsides are that it is relatively slow, and will only give guaranteed counterhits on moves with exaggerated hitstop (e.g Sol's Fafnir, Blitz Attacks); otherwise you will have to rely on your opponent continuing to press buttons to score your big counterhits.\nOn Counter Hit, knocks opponent midscreen, causes ground tumble, and wall sticks in the corner.\nKnocks down on grounded normal hit.\nThe Hitbox is very long, but deceptively thin for both versions, whiffing airborne or low-profiling opponents in most cases.\nSuzuran Sakura has no invulnerability and the same slow startup as Azami Sakura, making its usefulness limited to being a hard callout against opponents mashing in blockstrings. A good option to go for opponents who only react to suzuran with backthrow mash. It is negative on block and quite punishable on instant block. Use sparingly.On Counter Hit, knocks opponent midscreen, causes ground tumble, and wall sticks in the corner.\nIs slightly disadvantageous on normal hit and does not knock down.",

This means it cannot be used like most other fireballs, and is primarily a counter-fireball used to annoy people trying to zone and give you time to close some distance.\nSuzuran Yashagatana also has an added use as a gimmicky pressure reset due to its frame advantage at close range and insignificant pushback. It has the advantage over Kabari of not being weak to blitz, but is much more easily mashed or jumped out of.Staggers on counter hit\nCan YRC both versions of Yashagatana on frame 25 and the projectile will still come out",

                        "Description": "The foundation of Baiken's high/low mixup and one of the simplest ways for Baiken to close out a match. Youzansen makes for a terrifyingly fast overhead when tiger kneed, with the fastest possible TK youzansen being a 9F overhead that can come out of any jump cancellable normal as well as after positive-on-block moves, or even as a hard callout against low-mashing opponents. With 50 meter, Youzansen leads into huge damage when used in the corner and good damage and corner carry when used midscreen. Can be used as an unorthodox mobility toll because of the way it alters Baiken's aerial momentum or as a tech option because of its huge hitbox. All around an incredible move. You aren't playing Baiken until you start abusing it.\nIt's also an enormous move that comes out in 6f, covers all areas around her over the next 12 frames, shrinks her hurtbox during startup and trades abusively because of its very extended CH hitstun. Punishable on air IB but generally not on normal block in air-to-air confrontations. Good for catching characters that like to stall high in the air (e.g. Ramlethal).Input 62369S, 623693S or 632473S for TK Yozansen.\nAs of Rev 2.10, it is possible to combo into 5P, 2K or 5K(lightweights only) from a counterhit yozansen on most of the cast, which can lead to good damage in the corner.\nHer hurtbox becomes incredibly small during move startup and then expands as the move becomes active. This lets it dodge lows if Tiger kneed and makes it hard to stuff.\nUseful as an air-to-air for covering awkward angles. The hitbox takes some time (around 2-3f) to move upwards, so the move is effectively a bit slower if you use it to hit above you.\nThe hit itself does decent damage and can be used to end combos where you would not have gotten a knockdown anyway.\nThe startup of Youzansen stalls Baiken's aerial momentum, so it can be used to stall in the air and can be YRCed to leave her suspended low in the air.\nOn counterhit, has enough hitstun to execute a framekill and bypass RRC proration, which leads to 250 damage combos in the corner.",

Tsurane doesn't do any one thing exceptionally well but it is exceptionally high-utility and competently fills a lot more roles than most characters' supers.Minimum damage 10% (40% for burst version)\nFully invulnerable on startup, and quite fast. However, since Baiken's best mixups are usually tied to meter, opting to use it has implications for the potency of your offense later on in a match.\nLow minimum damage makes it not very good for pushing damage, but Sanzu always gives knockdown.\nPunishable between hits if blocked. If the second hit is instant blocked, the third hit can be backdashed for a potentially nasty punish.",

You must please our Sheep overlord by not getting hit. Play cautiously, fellow believer, and the Sheep shall grant you salvation.\nNon-believers can attack and knock away the Sheep.

As a worshiper, it is your duty to present our Sheep Lord with a sacrifice as swiftly as possible. Do not make our God wait.\nThe Sheep does not believe in damage, and thus only does 10 damage. However, the true wisdom of our God lies in dizzy damage. Our Sheep lord deals massive amounts of dizzy damage, that will guarantee dizzy on raw hit. You can combo into our Sheep Lord, but the dizzy damage he graciously provides to us will be scaled as well. Our Lord does not like to share, and prefers the entirety of the opponent to himself.\nWhen the Sheep Lord catches his victim he rewards his follower by teleporting him in front of it.\nOut of all the Overdrives in the game, our Saviour is, quite sadly, actually the weakest and worst use of meter for Bedman.",

For example in the corner, you can use it low enough to have only one hit connect, then immediately link a 2K, which is a hard to block setup, especially when you would usually do a 2-hit j.H. This setup is risky however because it can easily be backdashed. Also, if you try to land more than one hit of j.2K and your opponent uses faultless defense, you will be pushed back so much that the last hit of j.K might whiff, which means your opponent will recover before you and will throw you.\nj.2K alters Chipp's flight path, slowing down his horizontal accelleration\nMostly used for Chipp's FDC (faultless defense cancel), input: j.1[K]~[S]",

The ability to properly space yourself and stop aerial approaches with 2S is essential, as unlike most characters Dizzy prefers to anti-air by going directly underneath the enemy instead of stopping them at a 45 degree angle.  The hit box doesn't center on her body like in XX games, and is less thick and less tall.  This leaves it unreliable to AA with if the opponent is behind her.  2S is also one of her few buttons that can come out on top in trades due to its massive counter hit properties.

Its range leaves much to be desired. If the enemy is covered by your summons, then it may be possible to oki mixup into this move. It does good damage and leads to damaging follow-ups, it shines as a strong frametrap or a punish tool for big mistakes like whiffed reversals.  It also cranks up RISC gauge like crazy and is jump cancellable so is good as an incredibly safe pressure ender though can be weak to FD since the second hit will sometimes miss if the opponent is using FD.",

Like many of her specials it has an extremely early YRC point that can be used to control space, reset pressure, frame trap, or buy time to summon.  Without YRC Ice Spike is punishable even on block, and even more so on whiff so using it without meter to make it safe is very much gambling with your life.  With meter it is her best way to stuff approaches and reset pressure by far.  Make every use count though as YRC has a meter gain penalty and being significantly behind your opponent in meter will be an uphill struggle to say the least.\nLeads into many of her most damaging combos when RC'd. Creates an Ice Spike at a set distance (about 2D\u2019s range) and will shorten its range to appear in the corner instead of offscreen.  Can be delayed canceled after some normals to frame trap, f.S >  delayed 236S YRC  and  5H >  delayed 236S YRC are the most common examples of this and just the threat of it can lead to Dizzy being respected after blockstrings, especially if you've conditioned them for it.\nStun value .15X (lowered 85%).",

The defacto use of it is to end combos higher off the ground with an untechable knockdown, which gives Dizzy lots of time to set up okizeme. Due to the long startup, it usually needs supporting setups or routes to combo.  There's few grounded normals that can simply special cancel into it for a combo, examples are 2D counterhit, 2H (vs grounded opponents) and 6[H] (vs airborne) and 6P counterhit (rarely used). \nSituationally useful as a frame trap to end blockstrings against very active opponents, though it's still pretty minus and the gap can be easily punished by some moves.  If your opponent air IB's the fire pillar they can choose from many different ways to punish you.  With YRC it becomes safer but still is not entirely safe verse some characters.  Establishing it can be advantageous against some opponents to make them second guess moving/attacking after your blockstrings but often the better strategy is just to end your blockstrings with jump cancellable moves like c.S, f.S and 2H and avoid unecessary risk altogether or use delayed cancel 236S YRC instead which has less of a gap.\nStun value .18X (lowered 82%).",

Creates a projectile with a rising hitbox, then stops and becomes inactive before forming an ice spear which shoots towards the opponent. Like all her summons it has high recovery and risk, and a common mistake that new players make is using it like a fireball for basic space control, but the hitbox is rather thin and the auto-lock is easily foiled by movement such as jumps or dashes towards Dizzy.  It's useful to force opponents to move in neutral and as a filler special used when a bubble and/or fish are already out.  \nIf spear is out, Dizzy can often stop an opponent's movement by blocking, letting the tracking actually work and landing a counterhit or force them to block.  If blocked at any point Dizzy can often use her movement to setup frame traps or tick throws afterwards.  Can be used as a preemptive anti-air.  Counts as a multi-hit projectile in both forms so it will eat single hit projectiles and clash with multi hit ones, the rising ball can also be used as a shield of sorts against high hitting projectiles while still leaving her something on screen.  A valuable tool in some matchups.  It's also one of her fastest summmons so it can sometimes meaty in situations no other summon can.",

This version is slower but can be held, which creates up to 3 total spears when H is held, releasing the H button then unleashes the spears.  On hit it floats opponents into the air for a substantial period allowing followups even from far away and on block it locks opponents into blockstun for a substantial period, letting Dizzy safely get in and apply pressure. Like 421S the hitbox is also rather thin and the auto-lock is easily foiled by movement such as jumps or dashes towards Dizzy.  At further ranges it can also just miss crouching opponents who don't move.  It is also less reliable in the corner as the spears can go offscreen in some situations before connecting.\nA risky move in neutral due to its over half a second startup and unreliable tracking.  It can however be YRC'd to let Dizzy freely move while up to 3 spears are held, but blocking or being hit while spears are held makes them dissapear.  With specific timing of YRC, one spear can be shot while one or two are held.  421H are high damage so learning to utilize them in the proper situations is important, such as after 236S RRC in combos or after knockdown for high damage okizeme.  Spears only meaty off high knockdowns but a meaty normal can be used after summoning.  Some 421H okizeme setups are non meaty so require the opponent to respect them, however the high damage threat and conditioning of her true meaty setups allow other options to work.",

Has a pretty early YRC point that can be used to immediately lock down far or low to the ground and close air approaches and give you time to set up other summons. Although it's tempting to use as a safe blockstring ender, it's unsafe at most ranges even on hit, and by the time it's been active long enough to gain plus frames the opponent likely could have run under it or pressed a button.  \nIt's extremely active and can frustrate opponents who like to approach from high up in the air at 3/4 screen or telegraph their grounded approaches.  It can be avoided by opponents who dash jump or simply get above it before it can arc upward. One area 236P shines is in reducing risk of bad trades or trading at all due to the fact it's a projectile and stays out even if Dizzy is hit.",

The YRC point on this move is quite fast and it stays much closer to dizzy than ice scythe.  This gives it a lot of use as a pressure extender in the corner, locking the opponent down long enough for more summons or as a twitch anti-air midscreen, and for making it safer for Dizzy to trade, to avoid combos and in rushdown situations especially since scythe doesn't disappear when Dizzy is hit. Since it hits three times, it can also eat most projectiles. Overall this a great move to utilize.",

It is worth noting that the explosions have much less blockstun than the animation might suggest.\nImeperial Ray has good corner carry and is very meter efficient compared to RRC since there's no meter gain penalty and you rebuild meter and gain tension pulse forward running after it.  It isn't favored in use however due to consistency issues with it in combos further made unreliable by character weights, and being able to do more damage with RRC.  In the corner Imperial Ray becomes even more niche, as only a few pillars will be active before it goes off the screen.  It can be a very situational anti air or be used to close out rounds by creating unblockable situation or to hide other moves, such as 5D or 214H.

The mirror itself can actually reflects most non-beam projectiles, blows the opponent back on hit, safe on block. It has an extremely high hitbox but rather small horizontal hitbox, and is kinda simple to whiff punish. Decent reversal, and can prove an amazing reversal in some situations, for instance it reflects I-No\u2019s note,Sol's gunflame, and Ky's stun edge so if they meaty you with it, their own projectiles becomes yours. On CH it has the highest stun modifier out of Dizzy\u2019s entire moveset and in the corner, wallsplats the opponent and leads to a 100% stun combo (does 1638 stun value and 3363 on CH).\nThis attack will generally reflect most things that are \"standard\" projectiles: they travel in a straight line and don't do anything weird when they hit something.  Projectiles with different trajectories (Raven's orb), instant travel time (Dizzy's own lasers), unusual hit properties (Chipp's Gamma Blade), or other caveats will NOT be reflected.  Some moves that are or aren't projectiles (Eddie) are not considered projectiles by the mirror.  The mirror will never reflect supers, although sometimes the invulnerability will let Dizzy punish the attacker.\nFor a full list of what Dizzy reflects, check this link: http://pastebin.com/Vw4gdaKi\nMirror being so slow makes it very baitable by enemies expecting it, many meaty attacks can recover before mirror is active, which allows your opponent to do some nasty option selects vs mirror, being able to meaty in complete safety.  For example most characters can input a meaty low > close slash > block and then continue their pressure/combo if you didn't mirror and be safe if you did, in some cases mirror even whiffs making it not safe for Dizzy at all.\nThat said it can be a very valuable tool so don't count it out.",

                        "Description": "A mostly gimmick super dubbed \"Meme Ray\" by many players that costs 100% Tension. The slow startup, inconsistent damage output, being vulnerable at all times, extremely negative on block, and you can get more damage and utility out of 100 meter in a multitude of ways.\nIf Dizzy uses Gamma Ray while in Hellfire state, the attack will also blow off her vest, exposing her classic costume, though this is just an aesthetic change.\nMeme Ray has limited uses outside meming.  For 100% meter there's almost always a better option.\nThat said if you're feeling the need to meme some niche use cases include: Comboing into it vs low health opponents to kill them, Gamma Ray has a lot of hits which means it's good vs guts or to extend long combos where you already maxed out damage scaling and are doing 1 damage per hit\nIt does a ton of chip damage so you can win rounds if your opponent doesn't have much meter for FD and is already blocking a summon, possibly the most legit usage of Gamma Ray\nSupers beat blitz, though Dizzy has tons of ways to punish blitz without meter but it can be a meme way to punish people who do wakeup blitz a lot\nThe move has a superflash freeze after 13f which means it interupts opponents inputs.  Since the startup is 13f this is unreactable, but the opponent can decide what to do after superflash ends.  Since they only have 6f to play with post flash, they can sometimes do absolutely nothing if the interuption of their inputs left them in a state they can't block for 6f.  If they have at least 25% or 50% meter though they can usually YRC or RC whatever they were doing and block.\nIn hellfire state against Sol with at least 92 RISC it becomes a touch of death.  (Sol's a good example due to taking pretty normal damage).\nOne of the few (possibly only) moves in the game with greater than 100% proration.  100% proration means it does normal damage.  Most moves with proration are below 100% to scale damage down.  Gamma Ray's first hits apply 150% proration so in the very unlikely event that it trades it can lead to absurd damage conversions, even touch of death combos.  This also means if only the 2nd part of Gamma Ray hits it does far less damage.\nNote: Each phase of activation takes 50% meter.  So if Dizzy is hit out of the first part she'll be left with 50% meter. \nDoes 0 stun value after the first 2 hits where Necro and Undine shoot lasers.",

Bubble pops, fire spears, Ice Spike YRC/RRC, tap blitz, full blitz attack and more are also possible though it being confirmable requires specific situations and setups.  With 100 meter a lot of combos can be RRC'd and then IK'd.  Her IK is considered good compared to a lot of the cast for its huge hitbox, range, and active frames.  Her Gold IK startup of 10f preflash is slow but 5f postflash is tied for the fastest in the game.  The result is her total Gold IK setup is on the faster end which makes it easier to combo into.\nDizzy sometimes has optimal uses for Gold IK, for instance to kill someone in a combo that otherwise wouldn't kill due to combo scaling and guts, or to finish someone off with less inputs.

The value in [] concern the powered-up version.\nAll version got the same pushback on block, hit or whiff and isn't affected by faultless defense. Both version are also considered to be projectiles and will cancel any projectile that hit once (except overdrives).\n46H has to be done right afterwards if you want to keep shotgun stance.\nNormal SG-H\n3f normal. Extremely fast for its range. When done quite close, will give you a hard knockdown. Got no special properties when done a bit farther.\nGenerally a combo filler that is used either at the end of SG-P strings for a knockdown or looped on air hit for more damage.\nYou can loop {SG-H>46H}xN during corner pressure if you want to and it's actually possible to hit you out of it. However, the hitbox is so big that mashing out of it becomes a big risk. Past a certain distance however you won't get a knockdown and will need a RC to combo afterwards. Main reason why you would still keep looping it however is because of the chip damage, the ridiculous tension gain it gives and the fact that the pushback isn't affected by faultless defense. If the opponent intends to block and wait for you to end up too far to loop it, you can do SG-S and reset pressure for more loops.\nPowered SG-H\nOnly one word is necessary to describe this move: Ridiculous.\nRidiculous damage, hitstun and hitbox.\nMidscreen, you won't really get much out of it aside from a knockdown.\nIn the corner however, if done close enough, you will get a 35f wallsplat on normal hit and a 71f long one on CH allowing to loop powered SG-H into each other for huge damage. This allows her to reach one of the highest damage output in the game.\nPowered SG-H can be particularly strong during pressure too and an easy and low risk way to finish off an opponent with low health.\nIt deals 8% chip damage alone (ignores guts rating) and removes 20% tension if the opponent FD it while being +5 on normal block.",

Any other situations will generally require a hard read which makes it really useful only in certain matchups.\nDuring pressure, Elphelt can cross-up the opponent with it and make quite a lot of reversals whiff thanks to its invul frames. It will however loses quite badly against 2P mashing so you will have to make sure that your opponent respects your pressure before using it.\nOverall, a rather matchup dependent tool.",

Once it's activated, it can catch them even if they try to jump away. Can be followed into good damage in the corner.

If you YRC the hop, you have enough space for a j.K which grants you a typical empty jump mixup.\nDoctor Copter is a rare combo tool, but horribly unsafe at neutral. holding up lets you fly higher and will give your opponent more time to punish.\nCancel is the safest and most reliable move on pogo. You have more options on the ground, but if you are on the pogo in neutral without items, you are probably about to be punished regardless.",

However, once learned your mixup options improve dramatically.  Should also be used from time to time in block strings to avoid being too predictable, and you'll need to combo into it in some situations (such as a j.D FDC mixup out of block pressure) since I-No may push herself out too far to link into 6P against skinny characters like Venom, Zato, I-No, Millia.

Now you get stagger on CH, but they can mash out of the stagger in the same amount of time that the CH used to give, so it's a worthless buff against people that know the matchup and can mash out of stagger.  The problem with this move is that at maximum range you can't combo into HCL unless you CH, and on CH you can't really get much more than that (knockdown) unless you spend meter.  If they mash out of stagger they can recover quicker than you can dash in for a better punish, so the stagger is worth nearly nothing.  They also gave it 2 more active frames, but we're not sure if they replaced recovery frames or were just added in.  In most cases where you'd want to poke with this, 2S is a better option because it recovers slightly faster, has more range, and will actually combo into HCL on regular hit more consistently.",

Patch 1.1 increased the forward slide effect, so now you can link HCL from further away on most characters... unless they're crouching.

Unfortunately, hitting a crouching opponent near max range doesn't lead to any real reward without spending meter.  You can cancel into Note or STBT, but you'll leave a gap that they can hang you for.  They'll crouch under HCL, and 2D's nerfed range means you can't even knock down.  5H and 2H also have reduced range, and while you can combo into 5H at close range and link IAD j.K on tall characters, it's not as efficient as I-No's usual BnBs.  5D has enough range since it's actually bigger than 2S, but it's even slower than Note or STBT, and there's no real opportunity to mix up out of 2S since 2D (low) wont reach. Mashing could beat both STBT-S (low) and 5D (overhead) anyway.  Anyone that knows the matchup wont be caught blocking low against 5D in this circumstance - if you use it here, you're trying to catch them going for a punish since you out-range many pokes.\n2S is still a useful move if you have 50% to RC with.

Prorates 80%, but hits pretty hard itself and sets up meterless combos nicely when going into delayed VCL.Can be faultless defense canceled on startup for the altered momentum effect.  This is difficult to do if you have a Burst stocked, but you can jump cancel moves like 5K, c.S, j.S, and even j.D into j.D, then Faultless defense cancel to stay low to the ground for near-instant overheads, or to land and immediately attack low with 2K while they're reacting to your jump.  You can also delay the j.D FDC slightly to jump over the opponent for a cross up.  In Xrd, j.D FDC removes j.D's 9 frames of landing recovery, so go nuts.",

However, this move is still great when attempting to throw as the AA hitbox will catch people who jump away, and now that you can special cancel on block you have options if it's blocked on the ground.  Also works in corner combos when you're going to optimize for damage and end with HCL ~ D knockdown.

If you're going to use this it's best to take advantage of the range, so use it more like a zoning tool than a mixup tool.  You can try to catch people running in under a note or something - in a situation like that, most players are likely to crouch block and get tagged by this.  Otherwise, throw it in from time to time in the corner when you're at a distance.  Worthless on air hit, so be cautious given the risk of using it.  Very active, so you could meaty it on oki for shenanigans and use the unexpected frame advantage to score a counter hit. On YRC is a mid attack. A universal 5D gimmick is to YRC late into startup and hit low or throw.  Some buffs to other moves in 1.1 improved the damage you can get from this in the corner.",

On CH with perfect spacing you can potentially combo into c.S for a more substantial combo.  Usually though, you'll just get knockdown (or they'll tech).

Starts 2 frames after the flash so it's possible to reversal throw it right before it goes active if used at neutral (it's not throw invul), FD, or even in some cases beat it clean with an uppercut (Volcanic Viper) or some low profile moves (Grand Viper). However, throwing this super on reaction would be much harder when used as a reversal because of the restriction on throws when waking up.  Safe on block. It can be used as a combo-finisher but Fortissimo is a better option for that. Goes through projectiles and untechable knockdown. 80% prorate means that it can be used as a combo starter, but ultimately Fortissimo is a better combo starter due to no proration if you get an opportunity to punish.  If you have 50% meter when you run your corner oki, it's actually worthwhile to use 2D in place of 2K sometimes (since 2D doesn't prorate) and confirm into Desperation for full damage, then follow up with a full combo.",

Recovery is now listed as 16 instead of \"Until Landing\", it's active for 2 fewer frames, and it doesn't look like the input freeze is still present.  However, this move is still frame 0 after the flash, which means this move basically wins in any situation where the other player isn't invul at the time of the super flash.  It's + on block (no longer sure by how much) so you get to run a mixup if they manage to block, and on hit it sets up a high-damage combo.  Because the invul only lasts up to the active frame, Fortissimo will trade with or lose to most 6P attacks (the upper body invul) and will lose to other Reversals depending on timing and how much invul they have.  It's pretty much guaranteed to lose to an uppercut, though it may beat other supers if it goes second.  Don't forget that supers gain hellfire damage in Xrd, and beat Blitz Shield.",

Other times if the right servants are nearby, it might be best to have the opponent spit out towards them to try and extend your combo. \nIt does need to be emphasized that, despite the move behaving in most regards like a throw, the initial hit behaves like a normal mid attack, meaning it can be blocked and punished from all positions.\nIt can also be used a somewhat cheeky opener, depending on the matchup and what the opponent chooses to lead with. If it does strike, it puts you in an excellent position as you absolutely have time to set down at least one Ghost and get Aegis Field up if the matchup calls for it. It is a risky opening, however, as a number of opposing openings will beat it in frames handily.\nDo note that like all of Jack-O's D moves, it'll use meter if meter is available. The metered version has quicker start up than the meterless version.As of 2.10, the meterless version's direction and the timing the opponent gets knocked back on hit cannot be controlled",

The first situation is when you have the opponent in the corner and you need to buy time for your servants to catch up and lock down the opponent. In this situation, jumping into the air and forcing them to block the 3 fireballs from the metered version of j.D can be helpful when varying your tactics to buy time to keep your opponent guessing. The tension version is a block-stun nightmare.\nThe second situation that the metered version comes in handy is when you are in the air above the opponent. In this situation, the 3 fireballs can be useful to cover your landing against opponents trying to wait down below to Anti Air you. If the fireballs miss and you still have unused air options such as an air dash, be sure to use them to try and get yourself to safety.",

It also serves as her go to overhead off of a jump cancelable normal.\nIt's also plus on block depending on its point of contact.(preferably below the waist of at the feet. On hit it leaves you at a slight frame advantage and occasionally enough to follow up with 5k or 2p. From higher up, you will have to RC in order to convert into a full combo.\nIf not properly spaced it's very easy to throw punish if multiple hits, either it's blocked, hit or even on CH.\nGood to use after air confirms when you don't have a card to immediately return to the ground.\nIt's possible to link into 5k or 2p after Youeikyaku in some situations.",

It's generally used to get in on your opponent while they're applying pressure from mid to full screen and it can be Roman cancelled. Aware opponents will throw you out of it, or use very low pokes to punish attempts to get in.\nHamonkyaku - A swift low kick, causes light stun on CH. You can use this to apply fuzzies because of the ability to follow up with Jam's special kicks. Because of how her kicks work, this move will count as one of your special move kicks, so you can only follow up with two other special kicks. You can cancel the move with a kick before it comes out to trick your opponent into guarding low because the pruple flash still comes out even when you cancel before impact. Common use of this is after 2H but use it with other moves to give your strikes instant fuzzy situations. (Special note: in the corner landing this then Gekirin will not combo unless execution is perfect. An easier time would be to DP then Gekirin upon successful hit)\nHyappo Shinshou (puffball) - Good for stuffing air-to-ground maneuvers because of its large frontal hitbox. Solid blockstring ender and good on block, but aware opponents will punish the startup. Causes tumble state on CH. Combos directly into Senri Shinshou if you press HS right after the hit.\nSenri Shinshou (Heavy puffball) - Good for applying safe pressure. On block, it pushes your opponent back, on hit you get free otg situation. On CH you get wallsplat if you're close enough and tumble state if at mid screen. It crosses up if the dash for the move is extremely close to the opponent. The drawback is its especially long startup and lack of low profile, allowing it to be more easily stuffed, but it reaches the entire screen if timed correctly.

This also means you can get card and YRC it to recover faster.\nAfter 1.03 you gain card during max-charge as well so if you have to YRC or get hit out of it you still get a regular card.

At LV1, it's comboable into j.P, but you cannot airdash. At LV2/3, it's now comboable into j.K or j.D, and you can airdash afterwards for more pressure.

Landing a coin powers up Johnny's Mist Finer, drastically increasing his combo potential and offensive power. Because of this, when at Mist Finer Level 1, landing a Coin or combo'ing into a Coin is extremely crucial. Coin is an extremely powerful tool outside of combos, and often allows Johnny an easy way out of many difficult situations. However, because Coins are limited, knowing how to plan ahead and pace your coin usage properly is key to mastering Johnny. Having no coins left severely limits Johnny's combo potential - even with a significant life lead, being stuck with no coins puts Johnny in a severely disadvantageous position. On the other hand, one should avoid being overly conservative with Coins - losing a round with tons of coins left is generally considered a waste. Johnny's Treasure Hunt super replenishes two coins on hit - use Treasure Hunt proactively when you feel you need more coins to finish the round. ",

Mist Finer causes Stagger if a grounded opponent blocks it, and is entirely unblockable against airborne opponents.\nDisappears when a Mist Finer makes contact with the opponent (does not disappear if you whiff a Mist Finer)\nDisappears if Johnny is hit (persists while Johnny is blocking)\nIf Mist Finer hits as an unblockable, applies 60% initial proration. Only applies if the opponent is blocking.\nUnblockable Mist Finers are still susceptible to Blitz Shield.\nBacchus Sigh, AKA Mist, is used to create Johnny's infamous unblockable setups. Because of Bacchus Sigh's extremely slow startup, a knockdown is generally required to guarantee application. j.H, 2D and Zweihander are the main tools for getting a hard knockdown. Even with a knockdown, using YRC is generally required in order to properly meaty an opponent. Even when applying Bacchus Sigh on a downed opponent, because of its slow travel time, you generally must force an opponent to block 1-2 attacks before the Bacchus Sigh can apply properly.

When YRC'd, allows Johnny to combo afterwards. Good use of Air Zweihander forces opponents to think twice about how to deal with an airborne Johnny. Air Zweihander is also an effective way to cover an opponents wake-up options while avoiding most attacks. The first hit of Zweihander gives a hard knockdown, and is used as one of Johnny's primary air combo enders in order to get a hard knockdown. The hitbox for the second hit of Zweihander occurs around Johnny's midsection and downward. Connecting the Zweihander when the opponent is slightly above Johnny is a good guideline (but not too high, or Zweihander 1st hit will whiff). Air Zweihander has significant startup, so j.D is generally necessary to use to combo into it.Look how happy he is\nWhoever animated this man needs a raise",

You should look to convert corner 214K hits into RC>dashing 5D for optimal combos.\nAs for this move's projectile negation properties, it is functional but loses to multi hit projectiles and empowered projectiles such as Grinder Stun Edge. Has significantly more(>2x) startup than S Tuning Ball, but 1/4th its recovery. Therefore, it is best used against projectiles that are far away from the opponent, so that you have enough time to safely get 5D active and quickly return to neutral. If the opponent has YRC'd the projectile/is following their projectile in it is probably better to 236S YRC or simply block.",

It's safe to end pressure with normally, but it's common to jump cancel it into TK Stun Edge or to simply escape a situation. By late canceling other attacks into c.S in pressure, you can create a frame trap to catch opponents pressing buttons. On Counter Hit, it will combo into 6H, leading to high damage combos. It's fast startup and high damage makes it a good punish tool, too. It hits a bit higher up than implied by the animation, and works as an anti-air occasionally.

It is among the slower Dust overheads in the game. This overhead is much safer on block than Ky's Greed Sever. Also useful for expensive YRC fuzzy guard mixups when above 75 Tension.",

It's also surprisingly functional as a ground poke, so running forward and throwing it out is like putting up a wall in neutral that covers the air and ground. It hits twice, which is great for dealing with moves with armor like Potemkin's Hammerfall, it launches on Counter Hit which opens up high damage potential, and it is also jump cancelable both on hit and block which makes it hilariously safe as long as you actually hit the opponent. The startup can sometimes be a bit too slow to anti-air on reaction with, but overall it's very fast for how large it is. The recovery isn't insignificant, but it's relatively safe for what it is.",

It also starts up slowly in comparison to other reversals, and has a lack of forward momentum and range. Despite this, HVT is a good tool for dealing with pressure since it still has a good amount of invul. It also hits on both sides of Ky, making it one of the rare reversals that can be useful for dealing with crossups (as long as your input isn't crossed up). Ky is not left in Counter Hit or crouching state during the recovery either, so it loses a bit associated risk when the opponent has no tension to punish hard. As long as the opponent doesn't low profile it, you can use HVT RC to escape oki and pick up a combo if it hit, though you might want to save the tension for FD or Dead Angle if you don't want to play risky. Outside of defense, it can be used to anti air some moves that otherwise counter Ky's 6P and 2H, though its startup leaves a bit to be desired and if they see it coming in time they may be able to YRC and punish you for your trouble. It's integral in Ky's combos, including Vapor Thrust loops, Split Ciel loops, and Dash VT combos. On medium and heavy weight characters it will score knockdowns pretty easily, but light characters tend to float too high and can recover before hitting the ground."

Its upper body invulnerability, ridiculously fast startup, and long travel distance make it useful in a wide variety of situations. SD can be used to counter an opponent by sliding under their attacks that don't cover the ground, and to confirm knockdowns from combos and pokes spaced at the tip of f.S, 2S, and 5H. It's also commonly used to counter pressure during even small gaps left by the opponent. Though it is an invaluable tool it's also very punishable on block. This is made worse because it's also really finicky to get both the slide and the followup slash to combo unless you were spaced correctly or got a Counter Hit. Because of this it's risky to throw out unless you read the opponent correctly or can confirm your spacing quickly. Ky's neutral game becomes many times better once he has 50 tension because he can mitigate all the negative consequences of SD and threaten his opponent constantly with it. If it hits, you can save the meter or go RC it for damage. If it's blocked or dodged, RC or PRC will keep you safe and put you in an advantageous position.",

It's unsafe on block at most ranges, so it's primarily used in combos and as an advanced offensive option. While faster than most dusts, it has a unique animation and loud audio cue that makes it easier to react to.  Though it's somewhat lacking as a pure mixup tool, GS begins to shine when used to catch defensive mashing, backdashes, low attacks in neutral, and active and aggressive neutral play. Using Greed Sever when pushed away from an opponent is strong since it will catch air dashing, jumping, and some attacks. If it connects with an opponents block at the tip near the end of the animation it's safe on block. It's typically reserved until 50 Tension is saved up to RC it just in case it's blocked.

On hit it will stagger the opponent which can create some gimmicky mixup and pressure reset opportunities if they're not good at mashing out of the stagger. SC is also Ky's signature VT loop combo ender, it's the reason he can setup DC CSE oki and go for free IAD/empty jump mixups. Ending blockstrings with SC is an option, because it's only -1 on block and leaves Ky with a Grinder to work with. Beware using it to end pressure when too far from the opponent, since it has a decent amount of whiff recovery and can be punished if they're looking for it.

Bt.D will beat Bursts, Overdrives, invincible uppercuts, and Dead Angles. However, Leo can be thrown or counterhit punished on whiff, making bt.D risky if they're ready for it.\nLeads to high meterless damage in the corner. Midscreen, Leo can get a small meterless juggle, or spend Tension to convert. Character-specific followups on medium and light characters are strong.\nHas low recovery for how active it is. Slower attempts to punish with a strike will probably be caught by a follow-up bt.D.\nCan only YRC the first portion (third?) of the move.

After throwing the opponent, May has a lot of advantage to either set up an Applause for the Victim dolphin for oki or go for a variety of other mixups on their wakeup. If you have 50 meter, you can also get a full combo from the throw by RCing.",

You can release the button right away to send the Dolphin ahead of you before you start your pressure. This has 2 good benefits. The first benefit is that sending the dolphin ahead of you forces the opponent into blockstun and locks out their ability to do a reversal on wakeup when you start your pressure. The second benefit is that if you are already close enough to go for a mixup right away, the dolphin colliding with the blocking opponent can partially visually obscure your mixup. You can also release the button at a key point in your blockstring and take advantage of the time that the dolphin attacks to reset pressure.\nIn combos, if you already have the dolphin out and waiting, it can be a good way to extend a combo in places where you'd usually have to RC to get a longer combo.

However, the second hit has had its hitbox lowered, which makes it more stable in most situations. You now want the opponent about level with May for a successful corner knockdown. Additionally, hitting Ensenga roughly a third of a screen away from the corner will carry the opponent into the corner. Ensenga YRC moves May forward and upward, which can be desirable in some situations e.g. dodging Ramlethal's Calvados.",

With proper timing and combo adjustments, it can be used to knockdown the opponent without the need of Silent Force (see below), allowing her to keep her core neutral tool more often.",

Secondly, he now throws the opponent in the same direction as the lever is pressed, meaning he can more easily throw the opponent into the corner while on defense. These benefits come at a cost, and that's virtually no combo options.

                        "Description": "Potemkin rears back, then slams his massive body to the ground, creating a shockwave. This attack actually has two stages. The first is Potemkin's actual body, a standard attack that hits low and knocks the opponent down if they don't block it. Once he lands, the shockwave occurs: if the opponent is on the ground when it happens, they get knocked down. In both cases, the opponent is knocked down for considerably longer than usual, giving Potemkin plenty of time to close the distance, if applicable, and set up okizeme. Note, however, that if the first attack connects, even if it's blocked, the shockwave will not occur.\nSlide Head has some upper body invincibility as it starts up, which might be enough to get you out of a counter-poke, but don't rely on it too heavily.\nThere is also a window in which Potemkin can hit the ground and create the shockwave effects, but then YRC before the actual shockwave occurs. Great if you're trying to scare the opponent into jumping. \nYou can also time Slide Head so that the shockwave hits just as the opponent is getting up. Only a reversal backdash, blitz, or another move with frame-one invuln/airborne state, will save an opponent from this. You can then RC, slowing down time and extending their knockdown animation, giving you time to combo them while they're still airborne and do some big damage.\nThere are some exceptions to the rules for Slide Head's shockwave. Some characters have dashes that are considered airborne, which allow them to avoid the shockwave simply by dashing forward (I-no, Ramlethal, Dizzy, Johnny, etc). Generally these dashes have obvious effects, like teleportation, or make a distinctive sound when starting up to indicate their unique status.",

Holographic alerts fill the air around Potemkin as he bends forward, extending his body mechanically before rapidly launching himself forward. Does massive damage and blows the opponent away on hit with substantial untechable time. Unlike Giganter itself, however, it has a 0x stun modifier, so its damage isn't counted at all when determining dizzy state for the opponent. This makes the choice to use Blid an interesting one: do you go for the upfront damage and potential follow-up damage, or go for the dizzy and reset into an even more damaging combo?\nThe core factor for deciding which to use is your opponent's current healthbar - the more health they have, the more you'll want to favor going for dizzy. Positioning matters as well, since Blid only offers the opportunity to follow up if you're in or very near the corner.",

Difficult to avoid and also causes the most blockstun out of all the other sword attacks due to its attack level. Floats on hit. Requires H sword to already be placed with 6H. \n \nUsing 6H or 6S causes one of the two familiars to do a tracking teleport to the opponent and attack once. The familiars will standby at the spot where they teleported initially until they are summoned again. She can cancel the majority of her normals into a summon as well as the second hit of combination attacks.\nUsing 6S or 6H replaces the normals done with that button with new ones.\nRamlethal is in counterhit state during the entire animation of deploying a sword.\nBlocking or getting hit will cause any deployed swords to stop attacking.\nA sword cannot be summoned again until the familiar starts glowing again.\nWhile equipped, sword summons have less recovery.\nOn the intitial 6S/H, the sword will always go through the teleport animation. Any summons afterward can skip the teleport animation if the opponent is close by, causing the attack to come out much faster.\nAdded falling animation to swords being interrupted (increasing time before usable again) and familiars can now be hit on startup\nAs of 2.10, when ram or the swords are hit before the swing, the familiars respawn in the same position as before",

Damage taken during the duration of the stance is not immediately lost, but instead becomes \"Purple Health\" which recovers over time after not taking damage for a short time. Should Raven be hit outside of stance while he still has \"Purple Health\", he will instantly lose all of it and guts and defense will kick in where his normal \"Yellow Health\" is. (Example: If Raven gets hit while his \"Purple Health\" is at 50%, but his \"Yellow Health\" is at 30%, Guts scaling will begin at 48%)\nTake note that while the stance is able to withstand many sorts of attacks, including bursts and instant kills, Raven is still vulnerable to being thrown and to unblockables.\nThe \"Excitement Gauge\" has within it 10 separate ticks, broken down into 3 main levels which can be attained by a combination of holding the stance or getting hit. Each tick passively increases the damage of all of Raven's attacks, while changing the properties of certain moves for each stage attained.Excitement level 1 (Passive Face): Levels 0-2\nExcitement level 2 (Smiling Face): Levels 3-5\nExcitement level 3 (Tongue Face): Levels 6-10",

Where this move really shines is when he begins to fill his \"Excitement Gauge\". For each level gained in Raven's Excitement Gauge, 5 hits will be added to the move, up to a maximum of 50 additional hits at Excitement Level 10 (52 hits total). The full animation from the initial hit occurs even when used as an OTG, so this move is very useful to tack on a bit of additional damage, especially at higher Excitement Gauge levels. Aside from its use as a combo ender, Getreuer can also be used at any time during \"Give it to me HERE\" (214K) to punish your opponent for attacking through Raven's hyper armor should they be close enough.\nSuccessful completion of this super will cause the Excitement gauge to begin to deplete. Raven can prevent this with an RRC or stancing.",

This is used in several different cross up mixups where you would be able to combo into j.214S or even 2H.\nSurprisingly annoying to antiair with some characters when done at certain heights, although you will be forced to chain into j.D before you land to avoid being thrown upon landing if they were to just block it, or on normal hit if not done low enough to the ground, which would be the height you usually should have gotten antiaired anyway if your opponent has solid antiair options. The chain into j.D can be difficult for players to deal with as you can choose which hit of j.H to cancel into j.D (although opponents can always just upback it).

This move completely halts momentum during jumps/leaps until which it will return to normal, which can be useful after doing an IAD j.H cross up to convert into better combos with RC (j.H~D RC j.6H), since your air momentum will completely halt if you RC j.D before recovery frames. This can also be done using j.214S RC however, and is arguably easier to do with.\nThe halted air momentum also makes it great to sneak it an extra overhead during air gatlings on a grounded opponent, similar to I-No's own j.D. Ground bounces on counter hit, which is easier to convert off of on the way down as opposed to on the way up from a jump. Can also be used to bait throws during leap oki by doing it right before you land, which also is plus on block if you do it at a very low height.\nThis is also one of Sin's only ways of getting guaranteed knockdowns midscreen from air combos meterlessly in Rev 2. j.D won't provide strong oki as you will land fairly close to them with no time to eat afterwards, but the option is there.\nOddly, j.D can be jump cancelled on block or hit, although you won't get to use it very often, except for certain j.D knockdown setups.",

Not every character have easy access to these however, so they have to resort to hard baiting it, unless Sin is low on calories, or has no meter.\nThis move is a staple for many of Sin's combos as it is useful when cancelled with 236H, 236K, or even leap.

                        "Description": "[ ] values are charged version\nBurns 1,000 Calories\nThe infamous Beak Driver.\nDue to its sheer range, relatively fast start up and mostly disjointed hitbox on the 2nd hit, it's clear why this special alone makes other characters think twice when playing the ground game with Sin, as on CH (2nd hit) or with 50 meter, it translates into a full combo which hurts with the right amount of calories. On top of that, if blocked, Sin still has to ability to special cancel. This move used to be extremely low committal, but with an added 8 frames of recovery, whiffing it either by misplacing it or by a well timed jump by the opponent is no longer an alright situation.\nNote that each hit of Beak Driver have slightly different properties.\nThe 1st hit is much shorter in range and not very active. The hitbox is pretty much centered on Sin while it is active. It also is relatively easy to low profile, as it doesn't actually hit a lot of characters when they crouch. The first hit also has projectile cancelling properties. The 2nd hit, which comes out on frame 14, is much further in reach and more active. The hitbox of the 2nd hit gradually gets harder to low profile towards the tip. Although it doesn't cancel projectiles, most projectiles disappear on hit so it still deals with most projectiles well. Finally, on CH, this hit wallbounces the enemy which allows Sin to convert into a full combo with his leaps. \nIf the 2nd hit CHs, you can buffer 214 as Beak hits to confirm P/K on reaction to leap. With 50 meter, the most optimal combo is for him to RRC and then dash 6H > Hawk Baker > ... . Closer up on normal hit, it can convert into a knockdown with Elk Hunt, but if further out, the only option is to continue the combo with is 236H~HHHHH. The uncharged version is also the standard combo ender as it gives knockdown which allows Sin to eat safely, or leap in for oki after.\nSin also has the ability to charge the move, which can delay the startup of beak, potentially ruining timings of your opponent's approach/whiff punish attempts. After a certain amount of time Beak Driver is held, it becomes the charged version upon release, massively increasing the hitbox of the 2nd hit and making it extremely difficult to low profile, if not impossible. This version also has massive blockstun (more than lvl 4 attacks), making it hard to punish if you eat after. Despite the recovery frame change to the uncharged version in 1.03, the charged version still maintains the same recovery frames it had before, retaining its +4 on block while being hard to punish on whiff. On top of that, it does more damage and wallsticks in the corner, which allows Sin access to his more damaging combos. It even can loop into itself (usually up to 2~3 times, but more is possible with microdashes) if you manage to get them at the right height to trigger the wall slump state.\nGenerally, you don't get to convert off of charged beak hits unless they wallsplat, but you do get to eat afterwards, at least twice while keeping yourself safe. However, the 2nd hit still does wallbounce on CH, so the same conversions you get off of Beak Driver 2nd hit CH is still possible.",

In the corner, is useful when chained into 623S for corner confirms off of 623S's critical hit.  \nA strange property of Elk Hunt is that it has variable start up and travel distance, which changes depending on how close Sin is to an opponent during start up. What happens is that Sin accelerates until he comes within a certain proximity of the opponent. Once he is close enough, only then the active frames come in.\nThis is why Sin is practically always +0 on normal block as it rarely, if not, never ever hits meaty from distance alone, unless if done from full screen. It is also why f. S/2S>Elk Hunt is very distance dependent to combo. The distance you end up with after an opponent blocks Elk also can change subtly depending on how far away you were before it hits.\nThe mixture of its variable startup is also why it tends to lose to other lows and slides rather easily from a distance, even if you started Elk Hunt very early, as Elk Hunt can go up to 21 frames in start up if done from max range. This property can also make it lackluster at chasing backdashes.\nAlso be careful of opponents catching onto you doing it too often in neutral even though it is safe on block, as preemptive neutral jumping can translate into a punish.

If your opponent is aware enough to use OS Throw or has a fast 5H/6H, it becomes difficult to use 6K outside of oki.

However, using 6K this early also makes it more obvious for the opponent to reversal.\n6K feint, written as 6[K], is mainly used to set up a Throw since the opponent will not be put into blockstun. It can also bait opponents trying to Instant Block, Blitz Shield, or Dead Angle. Once the opponent expects a Throw after 6[K] and tries to react with their own Throw, you can start using BDC.",

Puts the opponent in a stagger state, which is mashable, but leaves Slayer in an advantageous position where he can try several different followups - 6H, 2H, IAD, another bite, etc. He also gains a temporary buff to his special moves, making the situation more dangerous.\nDash bite (6632147H) greatly increases the threat range for this move and is an important part of Slayer's offense. The input is well worth practicing.\nBDC Bite (6321447H) is more difficult to do but is a powerful defensive tool. If done perfectly (hit 7H within 1 frame of the dash) it is strike invulnerable all the way until it grabs i.e. a true reversal - but a slightly imperfect BDC Bite will get the job done in most situations also. Used most often on wakeup or after a K Mappa Hunch where the characters recover at the same time and opponent is likely to try to jab you.Grants a buff that causes any special and Overdrive to be a guaranteed counterhit.\n2.1 patch now allows specials to be whiffed while retaining the counterhit buff.\nBuff lasts for 180 frames (3 seconds) on a single bite.\nBuff timer now stacks with itself instead of resetting on a successful rebite.

                        "Description": "Once Sol enters Dragon Install (DI), Break\u2019s all-around usefulness increases greatly, even though its damage does not. Firstly, start-up becomes noticably faster, further enhancing its viability in neutral situations. While Sol does not hang in the air for as long to bait out anti-air attempts, the speed of the move and the danger of DI in general make it risky to challenge. Secondly, the flame that normally appears upon hitting the ground is replaced by a large explosion, granting Sol even greater advantage without the possibility of the second hit whiffing at point-blank. The explosion even hits behind Sol, creating potential cross-ups, although the minimum height requirement usually restricts this function to okizeme or other situations in which Sol is able to get high above the opponent. On hit, the explosion launches the opponent high and far, sporting a massive amount of untechable time. This allows Sol to easily follow-up with the jumping normal of his choice (including after an Instant Air Dash), or even (DI) Bandit Bringer during low untechable time decay. Because of this, (DI) Break is a very versatile combo part during DI combos, both mid-screen for corner carry and in the corner for j.D > (DI) Break loops. That being said, using it in combos limits your maximum damage considerably, so if you can avoid using it in that context, do so.Second hit has a massive amount of untechable time on hit.\nCannot be performed close to the ground.\n80% forced proration (first hit only).",

On block, (DI) GV cranks up the opponent\u2019s R.I.S.C. Level to a far greater degree than any other attack he has, basically guaranteeing that the opponent is forced into an automatic Counter Hit state if Sol gets the maximum number of hits. On hit, while Sol can opt to increase hits and therefore damage, there is an incentive to simply letting the attack perform its minimum number of hits. Due to the increased launch height on the final hit, if the hit count remains low, the opponent\u2019s gravity should remain at a state where Sol is able to follow-up with a sufficiently fast anti-air normal such as 5K or 2H and lead into an extended combo. (DI) GV also lacks several of the weaknesses of its regular counterpart. As Sol moves across the ground, he creates a set of high-reaching flame pillars behind him. This makes (DI) GV much harder to jump over. While these flame pillars can be blocked in any way, they do push the opponent back towards Sol, meaning that if a jumping opponent gets caught by a stray flame, they can potentially be pushed back into the rising section of the attack in spite of their attempts to clear it. Sol is able to Purple Roman Cancel to safety should he have the 50% Tension to spare.

Uniquely, despite being classified as an air throw, it is possible to land P.B.B. on grounded opponents, but only while they\u2019re already in hitstun. Combined with its fast start-up and short burst of horizontal movement, this allows Sol to end almost any DI combo with P.B.B. without needing to add any unnecessary filler, maximising combo damage. Due to its nature as an air throw, there is the potential to use P.B.B. for resets on an opponent attempting to air tech away, or to use it to throw someone out of Burst start-up.Can grab airborne opponents both in and out of hitstun.\nCan grab grounded opponents in hitstun.\n60% forced proration.\nStun damage: 30,50\nSupplemental Frame Data:Whiff recovery: Until landing+12F",

However, Roman Canceling Volcanic Viper is almost always a better idea since it is much less risky. TR is slightly unsafe on block, whether the opponent interrupts the second hit or not. As a reversal, the only benefits TR has over VV are that it has more horizontal range and cannot be Bursted. Although when 75% Tension is available, TR has the added benefit of allowing Yellow Roman Cancel, so it can safely be cancelled when the opponent is ready to block it. It can also be used on offense similarly to VV as a frame trap, but this is rarely practical.Hits twice. First hit launches, second hit knocks away and is untechable.

                        "Description": "The Dragon Install (DI) version of Tyrant Rave ver.\u03b2 (TR) is a very scary Overdrive. The first hit is basically the same, albeit a couple of frames slower, but the scary part is what follows. The second hit is replaced by a travelling blast of fire, dealing 15 hits total and travelling from Sol's fist across the entire length of the screen. The raw damage on this attack is immense, especially during Hell Fire, and the increased strike invulnerability makes it not entirely terrible to just throw out. While Sol is at a disadvantage on block, the pushback from the blast forces the opponent to either Instant Block the first hit and punish before the second, or not at all. Where (DI) TR really shines though, is as a late combo part in the corner. The projectile causes wall stick near the corner, allowing for easy P.B.B. enders. Furthermore, if you delay (DI) TR so that the first hit connects right before the opponent hits the ground, they'll stick to the wall low enough to guarantee the slump afterwards. Because of this, many combos with (DI) TR can then be followed up with a grounded combo continuation into an ender.First hit launches, following hits are part of a large, travelling projectile.\nWall sticks near corner.\n70% proration (hits 2-16 only).\nMinimum damage: 20%\nStun damage: 20,0\nSupplemental Frame Data:Strike invulnerable from frames 1-18.",

If used in neutral, Sol gains a great amount of initiative: He recovers instantly once the super freeze ends, and the combination of his speed advantage and his reward off any given hit is large enough that it becomes very risky for opponents to attempt to force the pace of the match into their favour. Of course, DI itself carries a large risk. When the mode\u2019s natural duration ends and Sol returns to neutral on the ground, he is forced into a lengthy recovery animation, making him incredibly vulnerable to a counter-offensive. Due to this, DI is only really recommended in situations where the recovery animation will not come into play, either to make a last minute comeback, to quickly finish off an opponent hanging on by a thread, or in a combo that can guarantee a safe exit out of DI. With proper timing, the invulnerability on DI allows it to be used after a knockdown as a big call-out against reversal attempts, especially those intending to Roman Cancel upon connecting. DI can also be used to create Burst-safe points in certain situations. Can be roman canceled just as the animation starts, only burns the meter for the cancel and cancels the transformation.Greatly enhances movement speed, all offensive specials and almost all normals.\nSupplemental Frame Data:Fully invulnerable from frames 7-19.\nDuration: 420 frames (504 frames during Hell Fire).\nEnding recovery: Total 62F, Tension Gauge becomes 0.",
