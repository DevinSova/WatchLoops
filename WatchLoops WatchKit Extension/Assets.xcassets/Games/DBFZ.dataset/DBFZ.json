However, after a corner Lv3 knockdown, you can time 236H[4] vs 236H and meaty them with a left-right 50/50 as they get up. This has rather low reward if Cell only hits with the overhead, but hitting with the rolling portion will scale the followup combo much less, reaching up to 4.5k with a Vanish extension.\nAir version can be used to instantly attack anything below Cell. The speed also makes it a good crossup fakeout vs IAD j.M, an extra overhead during a jump-in (23f at lowest height), and a good combo ender at high hitstun decay even if you don't have D Smash, as canceling it early will give you a ground bounce that combos into Supers."

Can still hit airborne opponent mid-combo, causes sliding knockdown.\nOnly hits once per combo, like most command grab.\nWhat seems like it would be an incredibly strong move is only just okay for Gogeta. A full screen command grab is good, and it can easily catch people off guard or be setup into easily. However, Gogeta can't combo off of this command grab without spending resources (he can pop Spark to get big damage and even ToD, vanish for a good but scaled followup, or just cancel into super) as he recovers too slowly to really do anything. He can maybe go for some mixups by faking out with a 2L/2M or something similar, but the reward off this isn't as huge as one would think if you do not have the resources available, or do not want to burn them. With these things available it is incredibly strong, but your opponent may realize what you are doing and this will become hard to land. Still a strong move, but not as good as it would seem initially.",

Meaning you can't DHC into Gohan and dump bars.\nDamage bonus from Potential Unleashed is applied to this super during the freeze as Gohan reaches the next level(s).\nEach bar adds 250 more to the base damage.\nMinimum damage: 20%. Is not affected by the damage buff per level.\nBecause of the short recovery, Adult Gohan can possibly combo post-super, or even set up solid oki with help. More notably, it can be used to DHC into from other supers that are still active. For example, Potential Unleashed lets Adult Gohan recover fast enough to set up for safejump 50/50s if he DHCs in during an ongoing level 1, like Kid Buu's  Pearl Flash, Vegeta's  Galick Gun, or Jiren's  Colossal Slash. Important note, he must DHC in right at the moment when the other character's super had just been activated to enable follow-ups.",

The big range on this command grab allow it to be somewhat tricky if your opponent isn't expecting it, or if you can cover up the startup with an assist or something similar. It's hard to get big damage off of it regularly, but it is still a solid option. Because of its slow startup, you can also just cancel it from a normal and have it grab the opponent because the blockstun ends by the time the actual throw comes out.

This assist also increases Goku's actual Spirit Bomb even if he already has one charged up, making getting the full level 3 charge way easier.\nWhile not an attack and thus hinders your team by taking the place of a more traditional assist, the support value it adds makes it a considerable option. Not only does it build large chunks of meter about every 8 seconds, it charges a Spirit Bomb level with each use, making Goku likely have access to a fully charged Spirit Bomb by the time he comes in, especially if he was at Anchor. The assist enables certain playstyles/team compositions who profusely spend meter to thrive, and overall removes meter deficiencies so long it is used every time it's off cooldown. It's very good at what it does, but may leave a hole in your team with the jobs a normal assist fulfills such as with combo extensions, blockstring pressure, and neutral.

But since nobody will just let you charge 214S all the way to level 3, you'll either have to find a combination of assists that lets you charge mid-combo or blockstring, or use his own B assist and charge it while being offscreen.\nNote that 214S > 214L+M is NOT a guaranteed combo, hitstun decay can kick in in the middle of 214S and the opponent will tech as soon as it explodes.",

It cuts off a huge section of the screen and forces the opponent to block at around superjump height, where a lot of players like to hang around. Blocking it drags them to the ground, allowing for your point character to run up and get pressure. On top of the upsides on block, it also has very high advantage on hit, allowing for superdash confirms pretty much everywhere.\nDepending on the point character, this assist can setup for unbeatable round starts as well.",

Not entirely that useful, but it's something.\nCan have some applications in some weird blockstrings that take advantage of your opponent being focused solely on defense. It can beat some buttons as well, as mashing 5L will most likely lose to donut, but will lose to most reversals. Some buttons will even trade, and most will just hit Gotenks right out of it, such as 2M. Some will whiff (SSJ Vegeta 214H), but this is small compared to the amount of them that will hit Gotenks out of it. 236S hold is better for that kind of bait anyway, so if your opponent doesn't have a reversal or the bar to use one, this isn't a bad idea, but Galactic Donut still has much more risk than you would like considering Gotenks has safer options.

For combos, it allows Gotenks to set up solo snap and additional damage, and for pressure, it gives him a lot of freedom to work with and mix you up in ways that leave you constantly guessing and afraid of the ghosts. They can beat vanish on wakeup, as they will simply teleport into the ghosts, so it's useful for that as well.

While it does enable a lot of characters to have unique setups into high-up combos, or even enable characters to get Dragon Rush in the air mid screen or in the corner without spending a meter, it also does not have too much use outside of that. As a pressure tool it is almost impossible to use - while Janemba is hard to hit himself during the assist so it will not be interrupted, it is simply four ki blasts and they can be easily reflected or superdashed through. This can be used for baits, but it is still hard to effectively use this properly. In neutral, it is hard to use for the same reason - it's tracking helps a lot, but it is simply four ki blasts and can be easily dealt with by most characters. He can use it similarly to Gotenks assist, and as such setups with Gotenks usually work with Janemba (although a bit worse) and in the air it is much better than it is on ground, but you still might not get a lot off of this. It's not the worst assist in the game, but it's not amazing either.\nThis assist really emphasizes Janemba's spot on the team as a point character, sometimes a mid - it can open up a lot, but you won't lose much if he dies and you can't use it.",

Far too risky and inconsistent to justify its low reward.Counter attack that works against projectiles and assists. Loses to everything else.\nHold the button to extend the parry duration.\nJiren teleports to the opponent's location on a successful counter, even if the opponent is airborne.\nThere are several special moves that consistently and cleanly beat Jiren on a successful parry. DPs are one such example, but Janemba's teleport and even superdash will evade the counter and gets Jiren punished for making the right call. Even assists that are already out can beat Jiren if their hitboxes are still active, such as beam assists.\nJiren CAN counter Z-Assists with this, which can catch opponents off guard, but they might be even more ready to prepare with a reversal if they're not currently doing any actions. If they are idle, they can buffer jump and not get hit.\nAttack comes out on Frame 5 after Jiren teleports, meaning the opponent can also vanish or input a quick special move to get them out of danger. If the opponent vanishes or does not get hit by the grab however, Jiren can vanish himself, though does not get him any follow-ups.\nCannot be comboed after without meter, and the damage by its self is lackluster for such a huge risk.\nHas a very obvious freeze to inform the opponent that an attack had been parried, giving them the signal to buffer a move.\nYou are more likely to be punished on a successful parry than turn the tides of the battle.\nMassive risk, only beats one thing, easily countered in return, and isn't consistent. Doesn't give him combos afterwards without suffering both meter loss and scaling thanks to vanish. While it can be useful against certain playstyles or characters, in most cases it is not worth the potential consequences.\nOnly use this to beat high committal moves like beams. Most importantly, be cognizant that characters can even use their Level 3s on reaction through the parry freeze, which can very well lead Jiren to eating a raw  Super Spirit Bomb. Very hard to justify using.",

The startup can also be obscured with an assist, making this much more useful when Buu has assists to throw off the opponent. Unfortunately, using this as a starter scales damage fairly harshly (it has the scaling of a 6M starter). If the opponent reacts or makes a guess that you'll do it, they can mash out since it has a pretty big gap.",

Due to the new Dive Bomb, for 1 bar Buu can combo into Fat Throw without assists.

Invincible on startup like all level 3's.\nAs of the Season 3 patch, the button can be held for Nappa to do just the punch and not the beam follow-up.

Minimum damage is 52*12.\nPiccolo throws a volley of Ki Blasts near the opponent. After a delay, they become active and home in on the opponent, one-by-one.",

This creates a bit of dead zone where the attack doesn't hit directly in front of your character so be sure to learn the spacing for when to use this assist in neutral. \nThe giant blast can be pretty good at masking what your point character is doing, helping you convert from mix-ups that are usually reactable, such as the universal overhead.\nBeing on the lower end of blockstun is bad, however as a low blockstun assist, it does have the ability to break cross-up protection.

Only mid-combo it can catch an airborne opponent.\nTrunks has ways to combo mid-screen into his level 3, but require resources like an assist or meter (can be half a bar or a full one), and also side switches as a result. Doing j.S > j.214H > j.M > j.H as an air combo ender does this for half a bar, and a well-timed vanish onto the ground after a sliding knockdown also does this using a full bar.On hit, leaves him at +28 right next to the opponent. Other than the typical IAD j.H safejump or some wacky Heavy Cyclone Jumps, Trunks can buffer Change the Future and it'll hit super meaty. Leaves him +4 on block, +9 on reflect and he'd still be right in their face, +14 on hit so it's enough for him to link into a j.L at the corner. Keep in mind this still loses to reversals with less than 12 frame start-ups. Another route would be buffering 6M in the corner which is +5 on block, +8 on hit, meaning solo extendable. It's as safe as Change the Future as both moves have 39 frames of total animation. Trunks can use Heavy Cyclone Jump to cause a left-right mix-up by holding 2 and picking a side. The fast fall makes it safe as a safejump, and it can be very tricky to tell which side Trunks is going to be on.Among the highest Super damage in the game raw, and used to catch your opponents falling asleep. Doing raw, the opponent can dodge it by jumping on reaction to the super flash, but at least it doesn't have a lot of recovery like most level 3s do. It's a bad reversal in general with the range of a jab, and again, almost always whiffs on airborne opponents completely. Being a cinematic Super, you have to DHC into it at the end or risk eating up damage from on-going Supers.",

It's got very poor range and for some reason, it cannot connect on crouching opponents; it will only work on standing opponents, which makes the move hard to land raw as a mixup tool. Its strongest utility comes in the fact that it can be used as an OTG off of a sliding knockdown. This lets Vegeta possibly extend into a bit more damage, or more easily confirm into his level 1 or level 3 supers. When done raw or done before Vegeta uses his launcher smash, a cinematic will play, and this will allow Vegeta to easily follow up and get a sliding knockdown.",

It's pretty good, especially considering Vegeta's role as a point character, so this isn't a terrible option. It can be a bit awkward to combo into due to the timing of it, but this is something that can be easily learned and dealt with. Using this depends on what you're looking for with your team, and there may be better C assist options. Still, it's good at what it does, and is easy to hit confirm out of should it connect.",

The angle that it fires at makes it hard for your opponent to approach if they find themselves on the other side of it. Not good on block but extremely easy to convert into a combo. Also protects you from Vanish.This assist is by far one of the most interesting and useful assists in the game. It's long active frames and angle of attack turns it into a projectile wall for it's duration. While your opponent can still reflect it, you are distinctly still at the advantage. It is also really easy to sniff out superdashes with 2H, as low-level players will try to use it to go through the assist.",

When Vegeta is called out when facing the corner, instead of staying close to the active character, he will perform it much farther away, making it near impossible for the opponent to hurt him and cancel the animation, and scaring them into blocking.\nWhile it's got some neat uses for scaring your opponents, being able to keep pressure consistently with assist B is arguably more important - while also having a better reward on hit.",

In the corner, j.H connects into j.2H, which can be useful for combos as well as converting off it in the corner if you hit an airborne opponent with it.\nCan also be used to convert in the corner from jh to 5L",

It has a lot of use in Vegito's strings, allowing him to set up 236x or 214x very easily, due to it flinging the opponent upwards. Its hitbox being wider than it seems allows him to snag opponents a little higher than him during air combos. In Sparking, it becomes jump-cancellable, which gives Vegito lots of unique and tricky pressure options. It's also good for snagging opponents below you, and for catching those too eager to get in on you with an airdash, though it may be a bit predictable.",

Very useful for her grounded routes, as it allows her to not only have great corner carry but gives her a solid combo option that doesn't use up her Smash, which gives her potential to combo into her Level 1 and get extensions. It's not fantastic in blockstrings but can be good if you catch your opponent mashing light inbetween your strings. It can have some small use as a bait as it can cancel into the command grab, but you're better off using different strings if possible. Also has some use as a meaty of sorts, although this isn't as useful.",

On hit, Flash will bring the opponent up, allowing for extensions that scale like a medium starter. On block, this move is safe and depending on the distance of the opponent, can put Yamcha away from the opponent, returning to neutral. Overall, this move is low risk/high reward for Yamcha when thrown out. Flash can be beaten if the opponent preemptively jumps and either aerial or super dash you, so take caution when overusing this move.\nFlash complements with his special moves, like his 5S and 236S, as these will encourage the opponent to challenge with non-special moves. 5S > Flash is also particularly egregious.\nFlash is also Yamcha's go-to for fast cross-ups during his Wolf Fang Fist pressure. Go in with Reverse Wolf Fang Fist or Whiskers and follow up with Flash for a fast cross-up that leads into high reward.",

Is quite slow for a Level 3 super.\nTracks the opponent anywhere on screen as long as they are in front of Zamasu.\nQuite good against assists, as he'll still do the entire lighting barrage even when it's blocked or whiffs.\nCan whiff if opponent is actively super dashing.",
