Lock them down with A and B bugs and hit them with a fully charged Crush Trigger, depleting their barrier and making the next C bug unblockable. Additionally, against anyone not paying attention enough, fully charged Crush Trigger leads directly into 6B for full curse, a rude surprise. Uncharged crush trigger doesn't lead into anything by itself outside of curse, but is independently useful as a combo extension after 3C in situations where 214B would whiff, allowing you to finish a pre-curse combo.\n",

It's the most generally useful of the clouds, but builds curse the slowest. Adds 20F of curse time for each frame opponent is in the cloud. (40F during Overdrive). Builds from empty to full curse in 5 seconds.\n\nType B is a ring shaped cloud that follows Arakune's movements. It can be used offensively with teleports and dashes to try to force the cloud over the opponent, but is at its most useful on defense where it can be kept at a middle distance the opponent wants to move through. Adds 40F of curse time for each frame opponent is in the cloud. (80F during Overdrive). Builds from empty to full curse in 2.5 seconds.\n\nType C is a flat broad cloud that tracks the opponent at jump height. It's extremely effective at deterring the opponent from jumping, preventing air approaches, and giving you largely uncontested ability to retreat in air in most matchups. It builds curse the fastest, but does nothing to prevent grounded approaches. Adds 66F of curse time for each frame opponent is in the cloud. (132F during Overdrive).

You can still jump and use any vertical components of special movements normally while slowed (such as Mai's 214 command backjump or Rachel's Wind), but any horizontal movement in such a move will be fully affected.\n\nHorizontal movement includes things like runs, walks, air dashes, Jin's Ice Car, Bullet's Drive attacks, Mai's 236 command dash, Nu's Act Parser, Izayoi's B and C version Mirage Thruster, and even teleport dashes such as Azrael's and Arakune's himself. It mostly does not affect moves that teleport with a set position in mind rather than a direction of travel, such as Bang's four seal Distortion Drive, Izayoi's D version Mirage Thruster teleport, or Arakune's screen wrap. (With the somewhat odd exception of Kokonoe's Graviton teleport, which barely moves her at all when slowed)\n\nIt is in your best interest as Arakune to end every combo leading up to curse with slow cloud so it becomes impossible for them to run from your incoming mixups, forcing them to challenge your blockstrings directly (very dangerous). It also makes rolling on knockdown as unsafe as quick teching for the opponent, as they won't roll far enough to actually escape from bugs, guaranteeing you can focus on committing to a mixup versus a neutral tech. If for any reason the opponent becomes cursed where you cannot immediately spit a slow cloud onto them, this is generally still the first thing you want to do to ensure the time spent chasing them down is minimized.\n",

This moves properties are identical no matter which teleport was used to create it, but some teleports are able to use it much better than others (Ground and air 214B are especially good for it). No matter how close to teching the opponent is the cocoon will always finish reaching the top of the screen before they are allowed to airtech. They will always be able to tech once it reaches the top, even on a Fatal Counter, so tag a curse building spider on the end of it if you can't follow up with a proper combo before they reach the apex of the stage. Alternatively, you can take the time they're in the cocoon to position yourself, set up clouds, or turn invisible; sometimes a better use of time if you weren't able to follow with a combo to build full curse meter. \n",

It's his only source of true reversal outside of Counter Assault and Burst, and it has a fairly impressive startup time for punishing those trying to smother you on wakeup or push their luck on blockstrings. It's also the only Distortion he has that's realistically capable of tacking on extra damage after a combo, and can be chained into itself if you have 100% meter. It's not uncommon to see rounds end in Curse > Laser > (OD) Laser to clinch.\n\nPre-curse F-Inverse can lead to full curse in the corner (5D > j.D > 6D > j.C > j.D), and 83% curse midscreen (6D > j.D > 22B). But be careful. Since it's your only DP most opponents will be scouting for it, and if blocked without another 50% heat to Rapid Cancel they'll have all the time in the world to punish you with the most severe Fatal Counter combo they can perform. Funnily enough, since both the laser and the body portion of the attack are considered their own hitboxes and are active through the entirety of the move, you can end up surprising some people by scooping them right back into the super when they run in to punish. To avoid this, all they have to do is remember to block the body hit before attempting their real punish, so don't count on it.\n\nThe Overdrive version of F-Inverse has more hits, a wider laser hitbox, and allows left and right movement at triple the speed. Try not to let the increased size and movement speed throw off your combo in the rare instances you OD super and still need to combo.\n",

The amount of hits this move does is somewhat variable, but it hits the most (24 hits) right in the very center of the move. Further towards the edges the opponent will be hit by less and less bees, often in multiples of 4, down to a typical range of 12-16 hits. Each hit gives 500F curse meter, so while it's rare to see someone be hit for less than 12 hits, it is not impossible to get caught in F of G and escape uncursed. On block the bees do significantly less, typically 1/3rd curse meter in the very center and a little less than 1/4th around the edges. \n\nIn neutral this super is a very poor choice, as 35 frames after superflash is plenty of time for your opponent to dash out of the super's radius and punish you for the attempt. Instead, this super is best used as a fullscreen 100% curse punish and way to start pressure. Catch a Tsubaki charging stocks or a Mai winding up a spear at fullscreen? Curse them for it from a range they thought was safe. If they block it, they still take a sizeable amount of curse and let you close the gap for some pressure. Additionally this super shines as a re-curse option. Pop this in corner after your curse combo ends and the opponent will have to start their new lease on life at a sizeable curse meter deficit right off the bat. Do it right with a cloud on the field or catch them trying to mash something and you might just get a free re-curse for your trouble.\n\nIn Overdrive this Distortion changes very little, gaining only 4 extra hits (and so barely any difference in curse potential). However the edges of the move in overdrive seem to have more generous hitboxes, leading to it being more common to be hit for a 16+ hit combo even at the very edge of its range.\n",

When summoned the curse gauge turns from its usual red hue to a royal purple as an indicator that the moth is active. Hitting Arakune will stop the bug from starting another pass until the combo ends, but won't stop it from finishing the bombing run it's already on, making the usual tactic of \"DP Arakune to stop the bugs\" largely useless against F equals. This lets you get away with increasingly unsafe mixups and approaches as long as the bug can cover you after the retaliation should the attempt fail. You can summon two Mothras if you are crazy enough to invest the heat.\n\nAs good as that sounds though, realistically this super is rarely used. It's hard to justify the 50 meter and time in curse spent summoning the super over just starting a regular curse mixup, as in most cases combos involving the F equals moth do about the same or less overall damage than a standard curse combo while taking substantially more curse time to finish. You also often can't complete your standard combos while the moth is active as it will break up D Bug's launch if timed inopportunely. In theory you can use the super to get more windows for resets, but that's also more opportunities to fail. Generally, just being in curse normally with 50 unspent heat is more efficient use of your curse time.\n\nIt's not all bad news though. For being what this super is it's unquestionably Fun\u2122 to use, and an amazing way to swag on your opponent. And in situations where you don't need a full combo to kill, this super is pound for pound your best way to spend 50 heat in order to get more chances to connect with your opponent while in curse. Pop overdrive if you have it to start the super with even the smallest windows of curse and have Mothra cover both your approach and your retreat should you fail.\n\nIn Overdrive Mothra loses the 8 hit cap per pass and becomes capable of multihitting as many times as the opponent is still in the hitbox. Usually this means 10-11, but in ideal scenarios it can be pushed to 15+. Additonally by simply Overdriving you give yourself more time in curse, meaning the super stays active longer. Without Overdrive you can expect 3-4 passes from F equals when called early. With it you can get up to 6.\n\nWhile not overwhelming in most circumstances, this super is probably the part of BBCF Arakune's game that has been explored the least. So its usefulness is also the most subject to change in the future. Outside of that though you're usually better off saving your heat for something else.\n",

If the normal gets blocked at longer ranges it becomes very hard to punish since Bang is mostly out of range of fast normals.\n\n3C loops are universal against all of the cast, but combos from it vary slightly from character to character now.

While it is mainly used after 6C due to it being the easiest place to chain into j.D, if done early enough, j.D can be combo'd into from j.C, allowing Bang to convert from even the weirdest angles in the air.\n\nWhile the move isn't used that much in neutral, it is a decent wakeup tool to kill meaty throws and gain at least 2 seals minimum with an overhead. A peculiar principle of j.D is that it forces you into landing recovery if you cancel\nit with a special or a jump if used high enough from the ground, even if you use something with noticeably less recovery, j.D's landing recovery will override it, forcing you into around a 20-ish frame cooldown unless you Rapid Cancel.\n",

The explosion itself is extremely active, causing it to catch opponents late into its active frames as Bang is recovering or clashing with many different projectiles, outright nullifying them in most cases.  Not only that, the explosion itself fatals, meaning Bang can securely followup with a punishing combo that can set up for oki, but you can't get too crazy due to the explosion itself being a short starter.\n\nBang can't cancel his recovery, but it's short enough that Bang is still effectively plus when the explosion is blocked. This gives him a cover from which he can mixup or followup with other ideas. The explosion only does one hit if blocked, but it's active for a long time. While it can be punished in very specific scenarios, the general usefulness, amazing hitbox and active frames, and the fact that it is safe on block means that drive explosion is a pretty good option to use.\n",

This move got its P2, requires a microdashing 5A for midscreen combos and total poison nerfed (was 800) but got a buff where its poison effect ticks faster than before which makes it better for neutral game. It can be implemented in every IAD combo. \n\nIt is useful in mid to long range neutral game as it travels pretty far and can be used to get in due to its start up and able to conserve air momentum (nail glide) or used with B nail.\n\nNot very useful in terms of tool as it consumes 3 of Bang's 12 nails so it is rarely used. It travels slightly further than regular version and can be used to poke people who are close to death. If you do any +D versions (basically A+D, B+D or C+D), you cannot do anything, besides rapid if hit, until you land. If you get hit while falling, it is a guaranteed counter hit.\n\nNote that each A+D version throws 3 nails simultaneously and throws them in a completely differently angle higher than D version (middle nail is more like A nail's trajectory). \n\nThe B nail got a buff where it regain its conserve momentum property from CS1 which has more applications in combos, neutral and okizeme, especially in the corner. Ending a corner combo with j.2C and then B nail will make your approach extremely strong and dangerous. \n\nUsed in close to mid neutral game and can be nail glided and combined with A nail. Note that several characters can duck under the explosion and still beat you out, when approaching recklessly.\n\nSimilar to A+D Version where it has not much uses and should be evaded.\n\nNote that each B+D version throws 3 nails simultaneously and throws them in a completely differently angle but higher than A+D.\n\nThis nail got an interesting buff where it does the web effect if the opponent block but the effect is short (around 1/3 or 1/2 of the effect). It is used to make your high jump-ins safe and can catch anti airs if spaced properly.\n\nCombowise it's the number one Nail to build Seals and setup oki.\n\nIts P2 got slightly better and is used to either get seals, setup, easy air to ground conversion or damage.\n\nAgain, similar to A+D version but worst as the web nail effect degrades as it stacks and reduces the combo timer badly.\n\nNote that each C+D version throws 3 nails simultaneously and throws them in a similar angle as D version.\n\nD Nails are used to give yourself space to get in or out. It is stronger due to the combo timer being more manageable so you can add an IAD with A nail which adds a bit more damage.\n\nIt is used almost anywhere in neutral as it covers many angle and bounces off the floor increasing the time they stay on the screen. Due to it costing 1/4 of your nails, you should use them with care. Since it partially conserves your momentum, it can also make your IAD approach safer or reset pressure when you do tk float into D nails.\n",

It can be used to bait anti airs as it stops your falling momentum and with combination with C nail, it can be used to punish them.\n\nFor mix-up, it is used to repeat the same or different air move as it keeps your height on initial use, so for example j.2C > j.22A > j.2C can be done as a double overhead jumpin mixup. It could also be tked from a jump cancelable move to add another layer of mix up options like overheads with j.B, cross up if you let the float last longer and reset your mix-up options if you use D nails.\n\nIt is used during combos due to its ability to keep Bang on the same height which opens up new combo path with either 6C or j.C.\n\nIt should be noted that during OD, FRKZ dashes can't be canceled from float. You need to press either A, B or C to dash after a float.\n\nIn 2.0, the minimum height restriction for J22A has been completely removed, allowing Bang to TK J22A at much lower heights, effectively giving him access to better pressure options, better confirms, and a multitude of options. \n",

They are also way easier to control, compared to the D Set nail.\n\nWhile A,B,C act almost like their ground counterparts, the D Version places the bumper directly under Bang allowing him to instantly use it.\n\nThe D Version is great for catching your opponent off guard in neutral and as okizeme from a j.2C ender.

Keep in mind that strings like these are vulnerable to reversals.\n\nWhile the dash is powerful it's also is hard to control, so try not to get into neutral during overdrive, since opponents will mostly get high in the air and press a lot of buttons making it really hard for you to get in without getting hit and even if you somehow manage to hit them it's really hard to confirm into a proper combo.\n\nWhen you have the 6D(Rin) seal overdrive can be used to beat out several strings from characters that use projectiles to pressure you.\n\nAlso, a weird property for FRKZ dashes that used to be in CPEX was that you can cancel the dash into a neutral normal.  This is no longer available in CF, so bang is forced to go through the entire dash animation if you wanna do something like 6Dash > 5A.  However, bang can still cancel his dashes into directional normals like 6A or 3C.\n",

However, the move has a few shortcomings, as when Bang tries to use it when the opponent is grounded and/or not doing anything during the superflash, when Bang teleports behind them, they can simply jump out and punish Bang with a jump in, or by simply Overdriving through him and land an incredibly painful punish on him.\n\nWhile opponents have even more limited options against the super in the air, since they cannot double jump out of it, it is still advised to use it with caution because an opponent can simply Overdrive through it, or if they have one, invuln through the grab and retaliate with a DP or a distortion drive, just like with the ground version.\n\nCan be used for a few tech traps as well as a sort of reversal, but Bang has better tools for those situations.

However, timing the delay on j.C can be tricky so it's often more consistent to use 6C> jc > j.D instead. This move is also wonderful to burst bait with during a confirm, as you'll often have just enough time to jump cancel barrier and still land j.D. You can also punish and burst bait with this move if you feel your opponent would normally burst straight out of 5C Fatal. Even if they don't burst, you can still confirm off of this.\n\nWhile it's rare to see it in pressure, it has some uses. It can low invuln through Foot Property moves, and if it's blocked you can stay relatively safe with jump back j.D. If you're feeling risky, you can jump cancel out of it reset pressure with j.C. The problem is that this consumes her double jump, so you have no air option afterwards. If you want to spend the meter, you can RC to cancel into j.C>360B for decent mix.\n",

It has limited options on block, and it takes time for Bullet's hurtbox to low profile. If your opponent has the same idea as you, you'll lose to whatever low poke they have. Your opponent can also react and throw counter outright. On the upside, In CF it has the ability to Fatal Counter for great followups like 6D. It can also catch people by surprise and get her out of some trickier situations because of its travel distance. \n",

The startup is slow and if your opponent is aware, they can super jump out of the way. However, its range and travel speed still give it some use. Use it to enforce the 6D/2D high/low. With at least one heat, level these moves are + on block, and QOL changes mean that on hit you can always special cancel and use an engage.\n\nWhile 2D is better for starting combos, 6D is always better for continuing them. It has more followups than 2D, and it can always convert into something decent. One thing to note though is that comboing into j.623C after 6D can be tricky depending on the character's height and hurtboxes.\n",

You mostly want to use it in situations where you believe your opponent will stick to you and press buttons after oki, or to call out pressure gaps. Ironically its slow startup can mess up certain reversal baits. \n\nA lesser known benefit of Bullet's DP is that, with meter, she can OS a rapid cancel if her opponent blocks it. On hit, the first part of cutting sheer cannot be rapid cancelled. This means that if you RC the moment Cutting Sheer lands, you'll only rapid cancel if your opponent blocked. If they were hit, you can RC the second hit into 6A > 6C > j.D for heat.\n\nIn CF, Cutting Sheer no longer gives guaranteed untechable knockdown and in longer combos will cause opponents to air tech before hitting the ground. As a result, you won't always be using Cutting Shear as an ender. Thankfully, it still leads into Bullet's safejump. After Sheer, input 9A > 4j.C. This will safe jump against most reversals in the game, beat mashing, and force your opponent to block on emergency tech. Be wary, though, because this loses to rolls and delay wakeups.\n",

This conversion is possible on almost the whole cast, although the timing of the second snap is somewhat character specific. Double Snap is extremely useful because it lets you squeeze out extra damage, prorates less than many of Bullet's other corner extensions, and leads to (66) > 6C > j.D \n\nOutside of double snap, this move sees use either to set up its followup, Flechette Engage, or as a way to squeeze out damage before Rage Aggressor in order to close out a round.\n\nWith heat, you can use its followup, Fletchette Engage, to blow people up, corner carry, and get better oki.

That said, reversals like these are always a gamble so try to mostly use it when you have 50 meter to rapid cancel it or a burst to escape the punish combo you're going to take if your opponents baits your reversal. Beating this move is a little different to other reversals since the two-stage nature of the move will beat out a lot of backdashes. However it takes longer to perform and is only invulnerable for the first strike, so if it does miss or get blocked, your opponent has a long time to react with their best punish.\n\nThe enchanted version of Griflet has a third strike that knocks the opponent downwards and ground bounces. It can be picked up with falling j.D to keep the combo going, making it great as a combo extender, it doesn't make it safe on block however.\n",

Regardless, it can be used to punish some DPs such as Ragna and Jin's 623C.\n\nIn neutral, 6C has a pretty large horizontal hitbox, but its long recovery and slow startup makes it a poor spacing tool. \n\n6C (level 2) is essentially a combo filler in the corner since it causes slide on grounded opponents, examples include Forward Throw > 623A > 6C (level 2) or 41236C(1) > 623A > 6C (level 2).\n\n6C (level 3) is an extremely situational punishing move. It can be used to punish Arakune's 236236C, Platinum's parry, Terumi's parry super, Azrael's astral and Mai's 236D (by using overdrive to make the second hit of her super whiff).\n",

Not only is it a fast low, you also can easily go for a very sneaky tick-throw if you 2B in deep. Finally it makes Hazama's hurt-box very small, which aids it in beating many more normals than one would expect.\n",

If you space it particularly right, you can even use j.C when you're falling back down to the ground to catch people trying to approach Hibiki after the shadow clone has disappeared.\n\nSimilar to j.6D, j.3D can be used to escape situations where you find yourself above the opponent with no more air options and at risk of being anti-aired. The difference is that j.3D will bring you back down to the ground closer to the opponent than had you used j.6D. This can better for you depending on the situation and matchup, or it could be worse. Judge the situation and decide which one to use accordingly.\n\nj.3D also sees some use in specific corner combo routes from 6C being used early in the combo.\n",

The overdrive version in particular is really good for this. In combo with a Fatal Counter starter and sufficient meter, you can link the overdrive version into the normal version for extra damage or style.\n\nHidden Phoenix can also sometimes be a good option for beating projectiles at closer ranges because of its invul and range, though mainly in oki situations. In neutral, you should only use this to call out very slow projectiles, or projectiles with very high recovery. Because Hidden Phoenix travels almost full screen, it can be used for half screen to 3/4 screen punishes as well, as upon RC you'll get a more damaging combo than if you had used Nue to punish instead. Keep in mind that Hidden Phoenix is slower.\n",

Very unsafe on block though so use sparingly or only if you have 50 meter to rapid cancel. Additionally, if you have an additional 50 meter, you can rapid cancel Nue on hit to convert it into a small combo to get some extra damage out of it. \n\nThis move is very fast but does not have invul, meaning it is not a true reversal and sufficiently meaty attacks will hit the startup. Furthermore, it is head attribute; that is to say, the opponent can reaction antiair you upon seeing the superflash if they so choose, or you can get hit by stray attacks during what looks like a punish. Be careful.\n",

Like Izanami's other Drive attacks, the projectiles fire from when Izanami started the attack. Unlike her other Drive attacks, however, the projectiles are closer together and there is a small delay before the projectiles start moving forward. This can make it useful for certain approaches where 6D can cover an angle while Izanami herself approaches from a different angle. Useful as an Okizeme tool to keep your opponent blocking while you pressure them. Also very good to start and continue combos when you can due to its excellent P1/P2 ratings.\n",

While it isn't completely invulnerable, opponents trying to grab you in this time are easy to prevent since they have no other options to mix it up with, and can be mitigated by using a low hover or moves like 6B.\n\nWhile active, you must consider how you wish to dispel Shield of Dreams before it forces danger state. This is accomplished by using Distant Affection, Stake of Supremacy, or Bulwark, each of which carries their own risk. If you do get danger state, remember that you can use Overdrive to immediately end it. However, if used early it'll leave you with a low Barrier gauge.\n",

Firstly, the hurtboxes vary. 2D produces a longer horizontal hurtbox, and 5D a longer vertical hurtbox. This also comes into play with mode change combos, where you may increase frame advantage during D saber combos by moving your opponent's hurtbox in a certain way by either standing or crouching. This is hurtbox-specific, so mess around with it! Secondly, 5D cuts all grounded momentum and 2D preserves it, meaning a Mode Change combo into a pickup will prefer to use dash 2D to close space, or maybe even 5D to retain it. \n",

A bit difficult to use as an anti-air thanks to needing a 623 motion, but still very plausible thanks to how quickly the head invincibility kicks in. In normal mode, 623B lacks combo options unless you are in the corner or get a counterhit. In Gain Art, you can convert relatively easily thanks to moves like Strike Fall and Astraea. Also functions as a late combo tool, gaining stocks or opening up Strike Fall confirms when otherwise impossible.\n",

On hit, has an enormous amount of untechable time, usually leading into some kind of workable knockdown.

On regular block, only characters with long and quick jabs (e.g Ragna 5A) can punish this after a microdash. On instant block, however, most of the cast can punish this move. Like many EAs with good vertical hitboxes, this move has a relatively average horizontal hitbox. At some spacings, certain characters can even duck and cause this move to whiff entirely. However, this spacing is very precise and difficult to maintain in a match.\n\nStartup is shortened to 10f if buffered out of OD activation or if canceled into.\n",

Since crouching hurtboxes vary, when j.A is used as an instant overhead several characters will be hit by only the first hit of j.A (requiring 236A angled downwards to confirm off of) while on some both hits will completely whiff.\n",

On grounded opponents, comboing off of it when done around the peak of Jubei's jump is finnicky as it does not have very much hitstun and, if not done close, Jubei lacks moves with fast enough startup and range to confirm into.\n\nWhile not the best for confirms, its speed matches j.B's and it has even more horizontal reach than j.C while also having a decent downwards hitbox, making it Jubei's best air poke in terms of range. However, as it cannot be jump-canceled on block and it is difficult to confirm off of higher in the air, it can be hard to do more than simply poke with it.\n\nA good analogue to this move would be Hibiki's j.C as their function and hitbox is very similar. The biggest difference between the two however is in their active frames (3 versus 6). As a result of this and other differences, Hibiki's j.C is a strong general use tool while Jubei's j.2C is more of a situationally useful crossup and air poke due to its relatively fast startup and range. \n",

Since the attack goes active after Jubei has moved and there is no invulnerability, he can be stuffed or even thrown as he moves past (he is considered grounded throughout this move). Your opponent will be unlikely to do this on reaction, but be wary of throwing it out around moves with lots of active frames.\n\nDepending on if 5D hits or is blocked, the length that 5D travels varies. On hit, Jubei will travel a fixed distance from the opposite side of the opponent allowing for consistent followups, while on block he will travel a fixed distance from his original location. While negative on block, when used at a close or middling distance, Jubei will end up far enough away from his opponent that punishing him is impossible outside of specific fast, long-ranged options.\n\nWith meter 5D can serve as a way to close distance on a far grounded opponent or to continue pressure. When rapid-canceled, with precise timing Jubei can end up next to his opponent on either side which can be tricky to react to. However, due to its long active frames, immediate attacks are granted crossup protection. A lengthier mixup option such as 6C, dash j.A, dash crossup, etc. can be used to throw your opponent off balance but these do leave small openings. \n\nYou can also use Jubei's 5D to dodge fast EA ([ABCD] for immediate EA) attempts. Done well, Jubei will cancel his previous attack and pass through his opponent during their EA animation.\n",

For the 5th swipe, Jubei jumps similarly to the last hit of the regular 236A. \n\nDuring install, Fissuring Slash (\"Rekk\u014dzan\") becomes a true rekka series. Jubei can vary the amount of Additional Attack slashes that occur during Fissuring Slash, choose between multiple followups that can create mix ups, or cancel to his command air dashes even while grounded to create space or do low to the ground cross ups. Jubei's pressure game here should not be underestimated and you can quickly smother an opponent with fast unpredictable pressure.\n\nWhile the individual slashes are minus on block, Jubei can easily choose how many swipes to go for and can deter mashing with his other Fissuring Slash followups, conditioning opponents to fear his options from it. If the opponent respects these options and avoids mashing, Jubei can opt to stop doing followups off Install Fissuring Slash's Additional Attacks and then reset pressure entirely! \n\nAlso, the hit boxes on this attack are pretty good at covering Jubei due to how low to the ground he gets if you decide to try this attack in neutral. It's especially important to threaten this attack as an air to air due to the quick startup. Also, the higher up you hit someone with the 5th attack, the more chance you can cause them to fly into the corner for the wall bounce, allowing you to land and link a 5B or dash 2B for an easy combo conversion!\n\nAs a final important use, this can be used to stall in the air by holding upward. Only the last attack has landing recovery.\n\nRead the special move sections below for information on their \"Fissuring Slash\" versions.\n",

Still, if the opponent is particularly mash-heavy, or if you feel the opponent is trying to up back out of a long pressure string, delaying this at points they are expected to mash can yield high reward.\n\nWhile a low, as Jubei's overhead options later in strings are a little lacking and 236B itself is unsafe - though very difficult to punish at further ranges - it is perhaps more suited to ensuring opponents respect Jubei's pressure than it is as a mixup tool. \n\nWhen used from Fissuring Slash's and its Additional Attacks, it cannot be delayed long enough to frame trap opponents, but it can be used directly after Fissuring Slash > Launch for this purpose. From Fissuring Slash > Launch, between this and delayed 4B, Jubei has a high/low mixup that yields a combo with meter or counter hit.\n\nJubei is at least +13 after an immediate 236B>360A cancel, giving you true blockstrings after and ample opportunity to diversify your pressure by doing dash 2B, or dash j.A as a quick instant overhead.\n",

On block, going for 360A after leaves a 5 frame gap that many characters cannot exploit.\n\nWhen used close and on a crouching opponent, Jubei can side-switch with the opponent. As this only works when opponents are crouching, this serves no purpose as a crossup but can be useful for positioning.\n\nWhile j.214C is a better ender for air combos due to better frame advantage and damage, j.214B lands more reliably and avoids the possibility of side-switch.\n\nIf j.214B hits high enough on an opponent, Jubei can link this attack with 5B to pick up and continue a combo.\n\nDuring the upgraded Fissuring Slash, it is an effective tool to stop opponents from trying to mash out of your strings. When used from Launch it can be delayed long enough to frame trap opponents. When used from Fissuring Slash's Additional Attacks however, it must be immediately canceled into. From Launch, between this and 6B, Jubei has a high/low mixup that yields a combo with meter or counter hit.\n\nDemon Fox on the ground can be punished by Instant Blocking and using a 6 frame move, as it is -3. \n",

Strictly a combo tool due to how unsafe it is.\n\nj.214C is Jubei's go-to ender for air combos as it offers greater frame advantage, damage, and potential side-switch. It is a little finnicky however as it is somewhat poor at hitting opponents above Jubei which can cause disastrous whiffs in unexpected situations. Whiffing (and side-switch) is generally avoidable by getting into the habit of super jumping into the preceding air chain as j.214C consistently hits when above or at an even level with opponents.\n\nWhen done close to the opponent, Jubei's delayed attacks after his jump functions as a crossup. If done further away however, Jubei is more likely to stay on the same side. As all hits are mids and this move is extremely unsafe, this should be avoided.\n\nIf used off of Jubei's 44 > 6 dash, it travels a little farther than fullscreen. It is not ideal as a means of approach, but it can catch people off guard and force Jubei's way in. Keep in mind that only the backdash has invuln and that it is quite minus on block and on whiff.\n",

Once Lotus is active, Jubei's offense changes greatly. Jubei's Drive (explained above) changes greatly, and Fissuring Slash becomes a rekka series. During the rekka, Jubei can cancel into all of his specials except for Rising Justice. Cancelling into a special will immediately end the rekka. Each special move has a simpler input during the rekka.\n\nJubei can cancel into Lotus from more situations than most Distortions. Except for Rising Justice, Jubei can cancel into this distortion from any special move on block and on hit as long as he is grounded. This means that specials like 236B and 214B can cancel into Lotus on block, essentially extending Jubei's pressure. On top of extending pressure, he can use it to stay safe, hit confirm and extend a combo, or just pop it in neutral.\n\nIn some matchups it's not ideal to go into Install State. If you want to use it as a cancel you're better off using RC instead, unless a specific install combo will kill.\n",

On hit, launches the opponent high into the air with a ton of untech time, allowing combos into a wide range of followups, notably 6DA and 2DA. On CH, causes wall bounce and hard knockdown, allowing for an easy 6DA or 3C pickup or another 6C for almost fullscreen corner carry. Frames 20 and 21 of this attack show the sword being fully swung and in the air, but do not have an active hitbox. This creates situations where Kagura's sword visually sails cleanly through the opponent, without actually hitting them.\n",

If she does, then you're looking at about 3-3.3K worth of damage. If she opts to go for a damaging route, then that damage gets bumped up to around 4.5K meterless with its damage only getting higher with meter. \n",

The reward she gets off of j.C gives her an air-to-air corner carry combo since j.C sends the opponent fullscreen. In all instances at midscreen, you will always follow-up an air to air j.C with j.9D. As an air-to-ground button however, it's basically 5C in the air but lacks in its ability to convert off of it. Your only option is j.2C but it only combos if you're close to the opponent and even then, you can't really do much unless you spend resources, do it in the corner, or land a Counter Hit j.C.\n\nIn blockstrings, j.C can either continue blockstrings or end them depending on whether or not Kokonoe has a Graviton out: \n\nIf Kokonoe does have a Graviton out, you can use Solid Wheel as a means to continue your pressure and get yourself back down to the ground safely. Using j.2C as a gatling would be safer here since you can simply activate the Graviton to push them away or use it as a means to do airdash j.B.\n\nIf Kokonoe doesn't have a Graviton out, your only option without meter is to do nothing since you can't Drive cancel this move on block. The massive pushback j.C has makes this move practically unpunishable unless the opponent instant blocks it up close, but even then it can still be hard to punish it properly. Cancelling it shortens the pushback and leaves Kokonoe open to a lot of punishes so be careful.\n\nLike with its grounded brother 5C, it's good in the corner as an ender for some air combo routes that'll allow you to setup Flame Cage oki guided by a Graviton.\n\nA little trick to know: The stalled air momentum from j.C can be useful for Kokonoe to keep herself airborne high in the air if she tries to time out the opponent. The trick to it is that you fling yourself high into the air using 236D>236B and then mash j.C to stall for as long as possible. This works even better with meter as you can use Super Ball to cover your fall.\n",

Flame Cage and Banishing Rays B can give Kokonoe enough time to do j.2C>5A on block. If she has a Graviton on top of them at midscreen, she do j.2C>j.236D to push the opponent away from her.\n\nIf Kokonoe lands this as an air to air move or if she's close enough to the ground, she can link j.2C into 5A for a combo. j.2C>j.214214A also works too since the timing for it is very lenient (just make sure that you're close to the opponent).\n",

While in the corner, you can let the throw animation rock and then follow-up with 5B (When far), or 2B (When close) into your basic oki ender.

While this is mainly done in the corner, there are setups that exist that will allow for midscreen ice resets which can be just as deadly as the corner setups.

If you can manage to create the space to get this out safely in neutral, B Banishing Rays will make it difficult for opponent's to approach Kokonoe. You can then take advantage of this to toss out Flame Cage and guide it to the opponent with a Graviton. It's also a very strong oki tool that'll both limit your opponents wakeup options and make it visually hard to see what mixup Kokonoe is going for. \n",

Leads to a full combo on hit because of the amount of hitstun it has. For similar reasons, it can also be a good combo extender if you need one and have 50 meter.\n\nLike with Flame Cage, Super Fireball will land a set distance depending on what button Kokonoe pressed and like with Flame Cage, Kokonoe can only have one out at a time.\n\nThe A version is generally the best of the three versions reversal wise and combo wise because it comes right down in front of Kokonoe and can be used to disrupt the opponent's combo on you, which will force them to either stop comboing you to block the fireball, or risk taking the hit which either way can allow you to escape pressure. However, the B and C versions can be good for catching opponents who were attempting to space out the A version. Please note that opponents can easily use moves that make them invulnerable or moves that push them out of the way to avoid Super Fireball (this applies more to the A version than it does to the B and C versions) so be careful when using Super Fireball.\n\nNote: There's a weird glitch where if you land Super Fireball as a counter hit on an aerial opponent, it'll launch them higher into the air as seen in this [video].\n\nDue to the P1 and combo timer nerf Super Fireball got in Central Fiction 2.0, Kokonoe will get less damage and time to combo off Super Fireball as a starter. Though the nerf will only come into play if she uses it as a reversal/starter, using it as a combo extender will still yield the same combos and damage as it always did.\n",

Despite being unblockable, Black Hole sees little use in practice because of the numerous conditions required to connect it and difficulty spacing it effectively. For the same meter cost, you have access to the much simpler, stable and reliable Absolute Zero (ice) resets. Note that projectile invulnerable moves can negate blackhole entirely if done correctly (Nine omni dash for example).\n\nTo capitalize on the bonus proration of Black Hole, you must combo on the exact frame the opponent touches the ground. This presents difficulties due to the fact that the height from which the opponent drops is randomized between one of three options. If Black Hole whiffs, Kokonoe is incredibly vulnerable to the opponents punish of choice.\n\nDue to the above, Black Hole is overall strongest in situations where you need to guarantee the reset, can set it up effectively and do not need the bonus proration to kill.\n",

It has a very high hitbox above her, so if people like jumping, and then double jumping above you, this will stop them in their tracks. Also, if someone is jumping at you in the corner (usually to bait your Tsubame Gaeshi), this move will automatically sideswap on hit - leading into a corner combo and a knockdown. It's main weakness is that it doesn't hit very far horizontally so you must be careful when/where you use it.\n\nHowever, that weakness can be mostly negated with the proper setup. 4B[m] uses the staff's current position, so Litchi can gatling from normals that extend the staff forward and give it more horizontal range. Much like 6A, the staff has its own hitbox. In this situation, Litchi's hitbox similar to 4B[e]'s. This property is primarily used for comboing after 6A[m]. Using this up close after 2B[m] is ill advised.\n\nThe staffless version of 4B doesn't have the vertical range of 4B[m] and still lacks a good horizontal hitbox.\n\nNot the greatest Anti Air in terms of range, but can still do its job if you have a grasp on its range. Those chances are infrequent, unless the opponent loves to jump directly on top of you instead of from an angle. It's H invuln kicks in a frame sooner than the staff version.\n",

Also, Litchi recovers incredibly quickly so even if the opponent uses GCOD on the first hit, she's safe (even if they EA).\n\nBenefits aside, IAD 2D is dangerous if whiffed. It leaves Litchi staffless, and j.2D(2)'s hurtbox extends before the hitbox.\n\nSome characters can counter the second hit if they Instant Block the First hit.

It can be used with a staff launch to make it safer and/or to combo with if you launch them in to the staff that's returning to you. You can also abuse its Body invulnerability to catch people off guard, so it'll lose to most 2As and 2Bs. It can also be used for corner combos such as 3C[e] > Kan Chan xN.\n\nThe Charged Version of this move makes litchi cross the opponent up and hit them in the back. This move is best used with a staff launch because the staffs launch plus litchi crossing the opponent up makes it seem like an unblockable. It's rare for opponents to block this , making it a strong mix up but be warned.....Even with the staff covering your body and making this mix up deadly and quite unreactable to block, it loses to OD > Exceed accel because it ignores the staffs launch hit and allows the opponent to EA you without fail. So try to use it early or mid match and preferably when the opponent either doesn't have a Burst or maybe on opponents that don't punish you consistently with it.\n",

In some BnBs, 214B is useful to set up Reach: Last Chance.\n\nOutside of those situations, it sets the staff at a good distance, so if it's near the opponent Litchi can threaten to launch it. In this sense, it's useful for making the opponent think twice about moving. You can use this fact to extend pressure and set the staff at longer distances. \n\nIt can also be used as a type of Oki after a near max range 3C[m] hit where 623D won't connect. Similar to the DP ender, this will leave the staff near an opponent on their knockdown.\n\nIncredibly unsafe if blocked up close. \n\n\n\nMostly used as a way to cover space and set the staff far away. Launches the staff much farther than the B version. Safe on block, but the startup is much longer and easily mashed.\n",

Pressing the Drive button and a direction will send the staff in the given direction to attack the opponent. If a direction isn't given it, will home in the direction of the opponent automatically. You can send the staff out before it returns to Litchi and essentially keep it in place.\n\nLitchi has one of the best OD's in the game for pressure for the following reasons:\n\nDuring OD Pressure, if you have the opponent blocking, you want to use your new gatling routes and cover gaps with a 5D or 3D while you run mixups or even do something such as 3D > 421C > 5D  in order to cross the opponent up while safely maintaining pressure. The staff is rather slow so you often need to move it preemptively.\n\nDuring OD combos, Litchi's main goal is mainly use 6C[2] in her combos as much as possible (for proration) and use her Exceed Accel or All Terminals as an ender. In her more advanced combos, mostly those with longer OD durations, you want to combo from X > All Green > X > All Terminal/Exceed Accel for maximum damage.\n\nOne of the most notable weaknesses in the form, somewhat ironically, is the staff. She has a much harder time catching opponents because she can't cover space by launching the staff as normal nor using staff normals.\n",

The input changes to 34123646D, and she can only use it if the staff is hovering behind her. She can still delay the initial kick and crossup as normal.

It has some surprising usefulness in other roles as well. 5B > 6A > 5B is a decent block string and can be staggered at any point. It can also gatling into her overhead, 6B, which many players are not used to seeing or reacting to.

The pushback on this EA is great, meaning Makoto is generally safe unless it whiffs or is instant blocked. \n\nOn offense, this EA isn't as useful because it'll send them fullscreen. Your opponent also recovers slightly before the animation actually ends. However, on defense this is a great way to get an opponent off of you and send them back into neutral for a breather.\n",

In neutral, you can use this as a unusual spacing tool when combined with an air dash or a second jump after it whiffs for some tricky footwork. Another way to use it is to preemptively go into it on rising jump startup near the opponent to simulate a jump in attempt. j.2C's recoil effect after it whiffs / hits helps halt your position in the air for a moment which can be used as a way to dodge an opponent's initial anti air attempt if used right, then you can air dash back in for a potential hit confirm after the recoil effect.

It is a useful drive move for dodging a lot of low hitting attacks in the game while travelling forward a considerable amount of distance at the same time but is pretty slow on start up. It's a decent drive to use to re-enter back in range for drive mix ups after a long pressure string with Noel's normals on pushback on a blocking opponent. You will also find yourself doing this a lot in corner combos along side things like D.5B for the wall bounce that leads into Revolver Blast. If you can get the height midscreen you can also use this as a useful viable screen carry also.\n\nIt is also possible to clash kill projectiles with 2D but is not a prominent tactic to do concerning this drive as its rare to do this in general. This is also quite punishable by Anti-airs or general pokes from fast reacting opponents as it does take a split second for the animation to go active in terms of an actual hit box after the hop.\n",

Although it's a bit on the slow side, 6D is a very useful move to dodge a considerable amount of projectile or body based attacks while covering ground. This makes 6D an effective tool in matchups against zoners or in certain long range spacing situations that Noel has trouble dealing with due to her short range. It is also one of the three choices to start drive pressure, next to 5D and 2D. It can also catch some people blocking high if they're expecting 6B. You can call out bad pressure with this move, but 4D functions better as a reversal. Both lose to F property attacks. It is most helpful to Instant Block into 6D when on the defensive to maximize its use as a reversal attempt.\n",

For the most part it's best to save your meter for more important things like making yourself safe by using Rapid Cancels, and using Counter Assault. It can occasionally be used as a method of exiting drive pressure without being at frame disadvantage or using d.6C.\n",

The interesting thing about this move is that it has projectile invulnerability starting on frame 5 and all the way until you land if you don't cancel it into any of the follow-ups and that it can be used to pass through the opponent in a similar way as Jubei's forward dash. The former can be useful for dodging certain, slow projectiles such as Lambda's 214D or Tsubaki's 421A. The fact that the projectile I-frames don't kick in until frame 5 and the amount of recovery attached to this move means that the situations in which you can use this trait successfully are pretty limited.\n\nIn the air, after Air Persia, you can push A/B/C 3 times for 3 attacks. The third attack will knock the opponent down in front/directly below/behind of Platinum.\n",

It leads to 4.4K+ combos in the corner or near the corner with meter. You don't want to throw this move out randomly as it is highly punishable on block.

When used after a Mami Circular in the corner, your opponent cannot roll or quick getup, forcing them to neutral tech and allowing you to pressure them freely. If they do try to roll towards a bubble, they'll get caught in it and you'll get a free combo! Chances are they won't be trying that again.\n\nBubbles can also be used as a way to make your opponent wary to approach; throwing out a B or C bubble from fullscreen will likely make them think twice before running at you, and will give you more time to switch items to whatever you want or to approach the opponent yourself. However, the bubble can be popped by almost any attack so exercise caution when using it as cover.\n",

Great for getting in and even better when used as oki mid-screen and in the corner. If you use it as oki mid-screen after 3C, you can use 236A to cross-the opponent up while they're blocking the first missile and they must block the remaining missiles in the opposite direction lest they want to get hurt. In that same light, if you have the Hammer listed as \"NEXT\" and you have 50 Heat, you'll want to use Miracle Jean the moment you recover form Mystique Momo and use the Quake for an unblockable setup.\n\nWith the super missiles equipped, Platinum rapidly launches her missiles one-by-one. Mainly used to punish stuff from across the screen.\n\nWith the bombs or super bombs equipped, Platinum launches all three bombs at once. The primary use for tossing all three bombs at once is for oki mid-screen. You'll want to cancel 3C into this and it will punish late rolls and grant you a huge amount of frame advantage.\n",

Rachel can also move a fair distance with 3C and wind.\n\nIn pressure, sometimes doing a winded 3C can be a good low option when Rachel has been pushed farther out to compliment her other overhead option for getting back in (jc j.2D > j.A). This will leave Rachel unpunishable, but will end her pressure should it be blocked. Linking a 2C after 3C on block is a risky frametrap, but works well if your opponent knows Rachel's pressure ends with 3C. Use this VERY sparingly or only when you have meter to RC the 2C.\n",

The level is dependent on Rachel's momentum when she hits.\n\n\nj.2C can be special canceled on hit, but not on block. Can cancel its ground recovery into a special or a normal on hit. On whiffs, Rachel will bounce, leaving her vulnerable. Level 3 is untechable, but due to the combo timer it becomes techable eight seconds into any combo. Using this attack in neutral is a death sentence since the hurtbox extends below the hitbox, making it easy to anti-air even with attacks that are not head invuln. Most of the time when you see this normal, it will be a botched j.236C input.\n",

Ground A-C Lobelia travel from shortest distance to longest. In the air, this order is backwards with A air Lobelia travelling the farthest. \n\nWith both B and C Lobelia, Rachel will be able to take another action while the projectile is still airborne, allowing for her to place Lotus in creative places or throw out multiple Lobelias at once. This means that Rachel gains the ability to create a difficult to pass barrier for the opponent to advance as well as gives Rachel the opportunity to convert the Lobeila into Lotus mid flight.\n\nRachel can extend the distance or change the trajectory of Lobelia by using wind. When Lobelia hits the ground, they will plant a rod where they land. Only three rods can exist at a time and rods will disappear and be replaced by order of oldest to newest. The rods can then be activated with either Sword Iris, Baden Lily, or Lotus, disappearing after one of these actions is taken.\n\nLobelias do not float on hit. Air B and C Lobelia knock the opponent towards the ground while A air Lobelia will send them flying across the screen. Lobelias can bounce off the corner, which refreshes their active frames, allowing for easier setups into multiple rods for Baden Baden Lily. This means Lobelias hit twice when used right in the corner, making them crucial for combo extension or oki in the corner.\n",

If someone commits to killing George, Rachel can take that opportunity to punish them or just summon another one.\n\nAnother key use of George is to force an opponent to block him on the ground, which gives Rachel time to run different mix ups. George doesn't last very long, but can keep the opponent blocking long enough for Rachel to move closer or give her more time to set up her more important tools: Lobelias and/or Lotus.\n",

As explained in the Tiny Lobelia notes, only three rods can be on the screen at any given time and if more Lobelia are thrown, the rods will be replaced from oldest to newest. When Rachel uses the Sword Iris command, a bolt of lighting will strike all the rods, creating a long vertical hitbox that extends to the top of the screen. Upon activation, all the rods on screen disappear and new ones must be set. When used appropriately, Sword Iris is very good for stopping approaches, especially from the air. It can also be used to extend combos or pressure. Because it floats on hit, Rachel can use it as a way to launch opponents without spending wind.\n",

Lotus do a small amount of damage on hit, but will attach on hit or block. \n\nWhen Lotus are attached, they can also be activated into lightning with Sword Iris while tracking the opponent as well as when they are attached to the opponent, at which point they're essentially homing rods. This makes them extremely useful for punishing someone attempting to out-zone Rachel.\n\nLotus has both quick startup and little recovery. As a result, it's become a strong tool to use in neutral and as oki. In neutral, it's a low risk space control tool with relatively high reward. For oki, Lotus perform a similar provides a hitbox independent of Rachel, meaning Rachel can block while Lotus is active, allowing her to easily bait reversals and command respect on her knockdown.\n",

However, Tempest's main use is its ability to regenerate 2 stocks of wind, making it great to get back wind when Rachel's running low. Best used with super jump back > 632146B. It creates an wall of objects that are difficult to pass. Should the opponent pass them, however, Rachel can still perform actions on falling. The projectiles can also be manipulated using wind, allowing Rachel to blow them downwards to cover herself.\n\nBe VERY cautious when using this move on the ground, as some opponents with projectile invuln or full invuln charges will gladly take the opportunity to smack you out of Tempest, resulting in you losing neutral, not gaining wind, and losing 50 meter. Examples would be Tager's B Sledge, Ragna's Carnage Scissors, and Azrael's Black Hawk Stinger.\n",

As a starter, the move also leads into respectable damage. However, 5B's attack hitbox is at the tip of Ragna's leg and mainly around his foot, so the most efficient use would be to check the opponent's aerial approach. If the opponent seems to jump forward without dashing a lot, 5B is a good check. Keep in mind that because Ragna's attack hitbox overlaps his character hitbox, a trade or even a counter will likely happen.\n\nCombos into 6D or Gauntlet Hades on counter hit, the former for max damage punishes at close range and the former for max range conversions. Even without a counter hit, max range 5B can be hit confirmed into Overdrive. With the proper combo route, the ensuing OD combo can result in over 4000 damage that provides a respectable amount of corner carry as well.\n",

Deciding between the two in various situations will require an understanding of the opponent's available options.\n\n5C is Ragna's 2nd highest damage starter, only slightly behind 5D(1) with its P2 94. Moreover, 5C seems to have a smaller hitbox, making 5C harder to connect on airborne opponents, although including slight delays into 5C may help when using in combos.

Just like with knowing when to use 5B and 5C, knowing when to use 5A over 6A (and sometimes not using it at all) really depends on the situation and the nuances of the matchup. Be sure to study the matchup when deciding on using 6A.\n\nUsing 6A in combos is the most stable way of getting damage on standing characters.

Moreover, with 6B lacking any chains to C moves, 6B lacks a completely safe block string. Because of this limitation, almost every Revolver Action option after 6B is either unsafe (e.g. 6A, Hell's Fang, Gauntlet Hades), or easy to disrespect (e.g. Blood Scythe, Dead Spike). 6B > 5D is the hardest gatling option to punish, as it only punishable on IB. Using 6B within a block string is not as effective as using 6B as a shock tactic move, due to its limited gatlings. Use 6B in obscure places that you believe the opponent will not expect an overhead.\n\nThe bonus damage proration that applies the first time 6B is used in a combo, along with its knockdown on air hit, makes this attack incredibly powerful in combos. However, using it almost always requires either a counter hit, rapid cancel, or overdrive, so it is usually reserved for big punish combos.\n",

However, this is limited by Ragna's combo routes as 3C cannot be used to end mid-screen combos (at least not without losing out on damage and corner carry) and cannot be performed after every corner combo. The few cases where 3C okizeme can be performed are after Dead Spike > Dash Cancel, intentionally whiffing the landing hit of Nightmare Edge, and instant air Blood Scythe at maximum height. However, the latter two options cut combo potential very early, and as a result will miss out on damage, meter gain, and health drain. Fortunately, even if Dead Spike was used very late in a combo, 3C will still connect and thus serves as a very viable okizeme option. In this case, the loss in damage and resources for not using either Hell's Fang or D Inferno Divider is negligible while providing significantly better oki.\n\nAs for the options after 3C okizeme, here are a few. Of course, you are free to experiment and find your own mix-ups:\n\nStaple launcher when meter is available for RC's and ODc, leading into higher damage than either 6A or 6C. The knockdown is greatly extended on counter hit, giving Ragna both stronger and easier to execute combo routes than what Not Over Yet provides. One particular route (which sadly isn't universal) makes him burst-safe after the initial hit by jump canceling, air blocking, then using j.C before touching the ground.\n",

Its still safe on air barrier block but very punishable on whiff so try to only use it once the opponent has exhausted their air actions.\n\nVery important combo part, so much so that it is used in almost every combo in Ragna's arsenal. The first hit allows him to combo into Gauntlet Hades while the second hit goes into Dead Spike or Not Over Yet. Most fatal counter combo routes require an immediate special cancel, usually into either Blood Scythe or Crush Trigger, resulting in massive damage. The only routes that can be hit confirmed (i.e. both hits of 5D connect) are either a grounded hit into Gauntlet Hades or an air hit into Not Over Yet, both of which provide much more modest damage so FC 5D sees more use in punishes where the first hit is guaranteed to be a counter hit.\n\nOverdrive version's properties allows the second hit to combo into any of Ragna's normals or special moves, save for 6D which only works on counter hit.

The hurtbox does not extend past the hitbox, so against Distortion Drives that have long active frames, you can use 2D for a free, decent combo. The move is also very safe when spaced correctly, so it acts as a good gatling finisher. Chaining into this move from a Level 4 normal or less will leave a gap on regular block, so be careful when going into this move at close range.\n\nIn combos, 2D is very useful thanks to its hard knockdown on hit. At close range mid-screen or at any range in the corner, it's possible to combo 2D into Dead Spike and into a full combo. The launch on counter hit gives Ragna new combo routes, usually into 5C mid-screen or into 6D in the corner.\n\nThis version's higher hitstun and its dash cancel property gives it much more flexible pressure and combo potential. However, 2D doesn't see much use in optimal OD combos due to its mediocre damage scaling and follow-up options in comparison to Ragna's other drives and specials, notably 5D and Hell's Fang.\n",

The special characteristics of j.D allow for a couple of mindgames, notably its incredibly short landing recovery. Overheads, lows, and throws can be performed from 6D, but it's sometimes tricky to be able to pull it off consistently.\n\nThe overhead is from j.D. There is absolutely no gap between 6D and j.D, no matter how late you perform j.D (unless you land before j.D comes out), so if you are close enough when 6D lands, the overhead is almost guaranteed. The only time j.D can whiff is when 6D hits too far away or the opponent barriers while slightly spaced away. Fortunately, you cannot be punished even if j.D does not hit, due to the frame advantage. The low is performed slightly differently. To perform the low, use j.D just before landing, then input 2B. Be wary that because 2B has a 9 frame start-up, many characters' fastest moves are able to beat you out. Your best bet for landing 2B in this situation is to condition the opponent to block high after 6D (using j.D), and then surprising them with 2B. Performing the throw is similar to performing the low, but it is riskier. To perform the throw, use j.D just before landing, then input throw. The hitbox on throw is very small, so any sort of barrier or spacing will cause the throw to miss. You can utilize a kara throw (B~C) to gain a tiny bit of distance so that the throw will land. Overall, use the throw option scarcely.\n\nSeparately, 6D also has foot invulnerability from frame 4 up until the last frame before becoming active. It also becomes airborne after frame 4, thus is can also go through grounded throws. As a result, this move can be used against players who tend to use lows or throws as a wake-up option or mix-up. Almost every unsafe low can be punished with a correctly timed 6D.\n\nFor combos, 6D is used to optimize the damage of counter hit starter combos as the bonus proration greatly increases combo damage while draining health (which is rare as most Soul Eater attacks usually harm a combo's damage scaling). Also used in corner combos after a launcher to combo into air Blood Scythe. The stun on grounded counter hit allows Ragna to combo into essentially any attack so routes off of it are very flexible.\n\nOutside of combos, 6D in Overdrive functions roughly the same. It launches the opponent much higher on air hit compared to normal 6D, and has more untechable time. Rarely sees use in optimal OD combos though it can loop 6D > air Blood Scythe if it hits an airborne opponent close to the ground.\n",

It may be more prudent to wait for the opponent to lose height, then contest them with j.A or 6A rather than try to snipe them with j.D.\n\nHowever, j.D is one of Ragna's go-to air combo parts as the high hitstun allows for more potential follow-ups than j.C, even very late into a combo. The move's lifesteal also makes it useful to gain a bit of life and increase the Soul Eater rate. While the poor damage scaling makes it a sub-optimal choice at the beginning of a combo, by the end the damage loss is negligible and the health steal becomes more worthwhile.\n\nSame properties as the regular version except it has more damage and hitstun. You can combo into Blood Scythe even at the end of long combos with this move.\n",

Guard breaking an opponent with the uncharged version can only lead into a full combo in the corner, and even then Ragna must be near point-blank range and start with 5A or 2A. A charged guard break allows Ragna to start a punish combo with any grounded normal and all specials except Blood Scythe.\n\nThe uncharged version actually negatively impacts a combo's final damage and eats up a good chunk of hitstun, thus resulting in the combo ending prematurely. The charged version meanwhile greatly increases a combo's damage and opens up new routes. Can be combo'd into from a normal hit 6C and Not Over Yet (corner only), air hit 5D, and counter hit 6A, 3C, 5D, 6D, j.D, and grounded Gauntlet Hades. A grounded charged hit leads into any grounded normal or special that isn't Blood Scythe, with 6D, 6C, and 5C usually being the optimal follow-ups. Using this move when the opponent is higher in the air will result in longer untechable, allowing moves with slower start-up to combo properly, such as 6C.\n\nRemember that Ragna generally prefers to save meter for rapid cancels as it makes his DP safer to use and improves his damage off footsies and mix-ups without the need of counter hits or overdrive. Thus, try not use Crush Trigger unless a huge damage opportunity presents itself or if the ensuing combo would win the round.\n",

Used on defense or in neutral as a fast and powerful reversal that is much harder to punish than Inferno Divider. Buffering it after an Overdrive Raid can allow Ragna to punish the opponent for using attacks that rely on long blockstun or cancels to stay safe. Note that while this move has a large amount of push back on block, it is still neagtive on block and cannot be Rapid Canceled.\n\nThe frame advantage on hit depends on Ragna's screen position and whether or not he is in Active Flow. The longer it takes for the opponent to reach the corner, the greater the advantage. Thus, Ragna is plus when he is cornered, even at mid-screen, and negative if the opponent is cornered. The Active Flow version is better as it is even on hit against a cornered opponent and plus everywhere else.\n\nThe low minimum damage of the regular version makes it a sub-optimal combo ender in nearly every combo, both in terms of damage and oki so only use it if it will win the round. The Active Flow version is actually useful as it deals good damage for no meter cost. It's especially powerful if Ragna has other resources ready, such as a counter hit starter, a cornered opponent, high overdrive time, and some spare meter (notably for a charged Crush Trigger or after a corner OD Carnage Scissors > 5A or 5B link).\n",

When Ignis is in sandwich mode Ignis pushes the opponent into its hitbox, so whiffs due to Ignis being too close are much less common. In OD 6D's Ignis recovery is shortened, although said recovery was never much of an issue. While techincally it can be low profiled, Relius can adjust the timing for it such that it's borderline impossible to do so for the cast.\n",

Relius can use the jump cancel to stay safe or convert the hit into a small combo. If Ignis is already nearby this move becomes insanely quick, with 16 frames for a large attack that can occur fullscreen. With Ignis' natural ability to absorb projectiles this move is perfect for interfering with opponents setting up far away from you. Similar to j.D, it can be used to halt momentum, initiate a glide from an airdash, and bait or dodge moves. When used from an air backdash the effective space covered increases and when used with a forward airdash the effective range shrinks. j.6D can also be used to position Ignis forward from Relius.\n",

Quick CT still reduces the full amount of barrier as well! The downside is that CT no longer ignores character combo rate. In solo combos CT can also be used to knockdown from 6C and even set-up safejumps.\n\nA charged CT can be completely covered with a single Relius normal and 6D with key timing, and CT also has enough blockstun to allow one to slip another 6D in before the opponent escapes blockstun. It's entirely possible to put an opponent in danger state and then guard crush them gaplessly with Relius as a result. Charged guardcrush has enough time to be followed up with 5D>665B or throw which allowing for regen combos, or with 214C which hits for massive damage.\n\nFor more general information, see the  Crush Trigger explanation in the wiki.\n",

Forgetting this can make 236C~214A whiff completely if the opponent was high up when 236C connected. The P2 has also been decreased so 4D is the more optimal move to continue from 236C with if 4D's bonus proration hasn't been used in the combo prior to 236C. The loss of vertical tracking can let you set up an inescapable Val Tus oki from 2C>6C>236C~214A midscreen if timed correctly. In the corner ~214A can be followed up with 5B, 3C, or 2C. In the corner, ~j.214A can follow up into 5B 3C or airdash j.B>j.C>j.236C>4D usually. In OD this move has a lot of untech and puts the opponent in a sliding state.

It has larger start-up, larger recovery for both Ignis and Relius, and it even picked up a hurtbox on the blades so it doesn't have safety from mash anymore. Ironically, it can no longer mobilize Ignis correctly either because of her stalking function. The unsummoned version has less start-up than the summoned version, so if an opponent isn't aware of that you can sometimes get a lucky hit in. On CH, you can followup from fullscreen into 5B > 6C > 41236B without much trouble. In OD it can combo into other specials.\n",

If she's close enough to the ground she'll sink to ground level and execute the command grab as normal, however if she's high up enough she'll do an airgrab version instead and restand the opponent! One can actually combo the air version from ~j.214A or ~214C/~j.214C in OD! It's also worth noting that the OD version of the move also travels faster. Used in some unblockable set-ups.\n",

If you send Ignis high into the air it can be used to make her travel proportionately far. Usual unblockable set-ups require the opponent to neutral tech in the corner, or else to have OD Vinum restand them. Usually used in concert with 2B to hit the opponent low and high simultaneously. Nose can also be implemented in some gimmicky IAD cross-ups on an opponent's neutral tech. In CF the unsummoned version of the move became much quicker and put standing opponents in crouching hitstun. This has its uses as a surprise overhead and can naturally be continued into 665C(1)>6C>41236B on hit.\n",

You can also use this for double or triple supers.\n\nThe restand property is particularly useful. You can end a combo with this super, then jab them so they can start blocking the rest of Vinum. While they're blocking, Relius and Ignis are free, so you can use 236D. Done properly, this will create what's called a \"vinumblockable\". You can also use 214D or other unblockable setups.

Also keep in mind that as long as Relius is not in hitstun when the move ends Ignis will stay summoned even after this move is finished. Many characters can backdash, take a hit and then airtech to escape when they see the move. However, Relius can jump up and cover this without much issue. Characters with DPs can DP clash the move until it's over for safety as well. New to CF is the fact that the last three hits will combo without counter hit even if they're airborne!\n",

Also facilitates ground-to-air combos very effectively for both a little extra damage and more hits with which to cycle through seals.

Keep in mind where your opponent is when you use it, as your available routes may depend on the type of knockdown you get (e.g. 6D > Crush Trigger/lvl 1 Hunter's Fang will fail if they groundslide away midscreen).\n\nBecause its initial hitboxes are very high up, you'll only hit opponents who are crouching or a distance away with the later hitboxes, effectively giving this move 25 frames of startup and making it -8 on block. While 6D has similar shortcomings to 2D in its lack of cancels on block, its good range and pushback can also make it a deceptively good overhead, though spacing will be necessary if you plan to use this in pressure without getting lit up. Beware of Overdrive if your opponent has it, as 6D's slow startup and overall long animation makes it easy pickings.\n",

As an actual guard crushing move, it gets rendered rather redundant if you have megalith powered up, but its uncharged version is particularly useful for setting up an untechable throw, seeing as Susano'o moves forward quite a bit during this attack, putting him in the ideal range for it.\n",

At level 2, the projectile throws the opponent high enough that you can always pick up with 2C. 3C can be used if hitstun hasn't decayed too much. The projectile also has a hugely disjointed hitbox which can be used to control space in neutral although it's somewhat risky to use. This also means that if the stomp part doesn't connect and only the projectile hits, Susano'o recovers faster allowing for better followups. The projectile portion is incredibly plus on block provided the stomp did not connect first. \n\nWhen used in midair, level 1 can be a decent way to tack on damage at the end of combos provided that you aren't too worried about unlocking a seal. At level 2, it can be used to convert aerial combos into grounded ones after specific strings.\n",

This is also coupled with no invulnerabilities, guardpoints or low profiling so you'll have to treat this differently from most commands grabs to get any mileage out of it. Also note that it will generally lose to other command grabs that have greater reach, such as both of Tager's 360s, since Susanno's hitbox is pretty much touching range when using this move. However because it can never be throw rejected for any reason, it can be a powerful tool when your opponent is teching since it's easy to get a meaty hit (Where they must start jumping or using a reversal as soon as possible to avoid it). Very powerful if you do land a hit with it since you're guarenteed to corner your opponent with them teching at your feet.\n",

It also is a very good combo tool that removes the need to dash or jump cancel like other characters would need to.  Usually in combos it gets used after a 5C, a link which eventually fails during long combos. Other times include after Sledgehammer B, Back throw and, with some timing, Spark bolt and j.D.\n\nThis move also has a strange property where the ground-sliding animation and untech time lasts MUCH longer when the opponent is hit by this at a low height. The untech time is long enough to allow combos of all kinds. The normal version will generally only combo into 2C, 6B and 236A but if you get the long-untech time version, 6A will combo into B sledge, 6C, and Crush Trigger as well, allowing a lot of combo possibilities.\n\nCharging 6A simply extends the armor frames and attractive time allows you to delay the attack for a bit more damage. Charging fully is generally useless, except if you read that a hit is coming and you want to guard point through it. Charging 6A gives a bit more hitstun to confirm the hit with, but doesn't open up any more combo paths other than a very strict 6[A] CH > 360B which is basically impossible to confirm.\n",

You can also use it to delay your jump-in momentum to call out anti-air attacks, but you won't get a counterhit that way usually, on hitting a grounded opponent, you usually only have time for gadget finger, if at all, but you can rapid cancel the fall to eliminate the landing recovery and pick the combo up with 5B. It's still very risky however, since it's very punishable on block.\n\nIn combos this move is very frequently used after 6C to bring the opponent back down to earth. Ensure you hit them as with Tager as low as you can to give yourself time to recover and use 5B. \n\nThe quick start up version seems to be a bug that was deliberately left in the game where the game cancels much of the startup into the landing animation (which has some active frames). This quick version is useful for getting surprise fatal counters on jump ins, and is also quite safe. However its use is very limited due to the rather precise height you need to be to activate it. Bizarrely enough it's still an overhead when you do this.\n",

When using it in neutral, expect to land it on block since it is very telegraphed, however it does leave you at a slight advantage and very close to your opponent, a very nice place for Tager to be.\n\nIn overdrive, this move becomes much more interesting as it is the only meterless move Tager has with a foot guardpoint, allowing him to advance on characters who have long ranged Foot attribute moves that normally stuff Sledgehammer (Such as Kagura and Es).\n\n2D has no cancels possible outside of Rapid cancels.

Air hits can also be followed up reasonably easily without even a counterhit.\nIn addition, j.D is an amazing move for combos because it has a fantastic P2 and so much untechable time that Tager will usually be able to land and continue with a ground combo, even in slightly high hitstun reduction. During fatal counter combos, it combines with j.C to form an extremely damaging loop.\n",

                        "Description": "Compared to previous versions of Tager, the Gigantic Tager Driver has been streamlined from two versions into just one. Consequently, this variation is about as fast as his old B version Driver with holding extending his active time, but has similar invulnerability  and does the same damage as his classic A Driver. The 6 frame startup and short invulnerability means it can be used as a weak reversal and to win close range jab pressure, but be wary of being predictable as it is extremely punishable and vunlerable to jump cancels, frametraps and meaty attacks. As with all of Tager's meterless grabs, you'll want to follow this up with Gadget Finger, nothing else will work (There's no RC option either).\n\nWhile it might seem as a Grappler that your gameplan should revolve around landing this move, it actually only leads to weak damage compared to Tager's other options. Typically you'll need to use this move to keep your opponent from doing bad blockstrings on the ground and also to win out point-blank jab contests when at near-neutral frame advantage, forcing your opponent to play less aggressively. Players playing against you will fear this move and you can use this to make them make other mistakes instead.\n",

It sees most usage as a tool for calling out moves and even an anti-jump in due to the generous invulnerability window between frames 6-30. However it has a slow, 30 frame startup, and 30 frames of recovery, meaning that abusing it or whiffing it will lead to eating a painful punish. \n\nWedge Catapault, like Atomic Collider, doesn't purple throw mid-combo, meaning that you can use it as a combo tool in some situations (After a 5D standing Counterhit for example). As a starter, it allows for followup combos with 6c or a delayed 5c, though the overall damage from a combo with Wedge as the starter is somewhat low. The Catapult itself prevents the opponent from teching whilst they're spinning in midair, meaning that until they hit the ground there's no way to get away from the follow-up combo, or the follow-up, Impact Driver. Which route you go will depend largely on how much health they have left, with the combo giving more damage overall.\n\nWhile it has an excellent P2, making it great for use in combos, be aware that the move requires a lot of time to fully perform, meaning that the remaining combo will be cut short due to hitstun decay.\n\nWhilst it's not a great move to use on wakeup, you can use Wedge immediately after Gadget Finger to punish players who don't respect your grabs and remain grounded.\n\nThe moves this can be comboed into are as follows:\nGadget Finger (needs Rapid cancel)\n5D Counter hit\nj.D Counterhit (When performed very low to the ground)\nB Sledgehammer counterhit\n6A Max Charge Counterhit\n",

It's fast enough to combo after his \"Driver\" command throws, giving him easy pressure afterward, albeit one that can be disrespected with Overdrive, DP's and EA. However, with the right conditioning and setup, they won't dare to do so.\n\nHowever, a smart player quickly notices that Gadget Finger allows much more than this option. For starters, it actually has infinite untech time due to it putting them in grounded hitstun in the air, which leads into two things\u00a0: it allows the now infamous Timeout Tager loop (or \"the circus\"), or for new gimmicky combos.\n\nThe timeout is done by doing Gadget Finger, rapid-cancelling it and repeatedly doing whiffed Air Drivers (360C). This is much harder than it sounds, and must be done with great care to not launch the opponent too far away, or too high for another successful Driver whiff. If done correctly, with 100 meter, it can easily grant Tager a timeout win even when a lot of time is remaining in the match.\n\nEven though GF drops farther back now, it actually had it's advantage after it increased, now allowing Tager to followup with 5A on characters like Arakune, Susanoo and another Tager. Fatal Counter allows GF > Spark Bolt on pretty much anyone, 5B on Tager, 5A > 3C on larger and wonky hitbox characters and even allows GF RC > 360B if the combo started with an FC. These combo paths however are more on the impractical side of the spectrum so it's better not to use them in serious gameplay.\n\nOverall, with the new timeout and combos it gives, GF became a much more useful and threatening tool, while it's okizeme potential is left unchanged (it's harder to maintain it though due to the bigger distance between Tager and the enemy). Smart use of this move will pay off incredibly well, a 700-800 damage at the end of any combo via 360Bx2 isn't that bad either!\n",

This isn't a move to be thrown out lightly since anyone familiar with fighting against Tager will be keen to bait this move out with their own jump cancellable normals and other throw safe moves. Try to use it at more unpredictable times or in conjunction with Overdrive to see if they're vulnerable before committing your heat as well (You can easily buffer this move during overdrive startup). Remember to take advantage of the fact that it can pull in enemies from surprising distances before it goes active, for example, you can use it to catch Ragna using his 5B at full range if he is magnetised.\n\nSadly, unlike other Distortion drives, this move requires you to commit 50 Heat up front to even attempt it (There's no way to combo into it), and even if it hits, you have no way to follow it up with any other move and they are free to tech roll away. For this reason you generally want to use this as a round ender rather than a way to do big damage mid round.\n",

Fairly long recovery on whiff, and will leave you in a crouching position if you're hit.\n\n2C is a great move for catching opponents that approach in the air at an angle due to its diagonal shape, but it is completely useless against characters that have air moves that allow them to hit from directly above or behind you as 2C will whiff easily. Jin's j.2C with its amazing vertical hitbox and Azrael's j.B with its ridiculous crossup hitbox come to mind.\n\nIf 2C is used on a juggled opponent that is close enough to the ground, the opponent will not be able to tech before they land which allows this move to be used as a combo ender in some cases to provide a knockdown.

Downs the opponent on air hit.\n\nThis move can also help close distance in pressure against opponents who abuse barrier, but it is not jump cancellable on block so pressure can be ended safely by cancelling into 421A or 22B. Cancelling into 421A can be used to extend pressure if the opponent insists on staying grounded since you can run in while the opponent is blocking the projectile. This special cancellability can also be used to get in sneaky command grabs effortlessly if the opponent does not use barrier while 6C lands. Gatlings into 6CC.\n\nYou can perform kara throws with this move by inputting 6C~B in quick succession (A 3 frame window). Tsubaki will say the voice line for 6C and will appear to step forward and perform a grab. Kara throws allow Tsubaki to threaten grabs outside of normal range.\n",

The short hop that she does can be used as both a mixup and a frame trap after a j.C that is done very close to the ground.

In Overdrive, the reduced recovery allows j.C and j.CC to be linked to another j.C which slightly increases combo damage. This requires tight spacing and can only be utilized if you haven't used an air option.

It travels the same distance as the B version. It leaves you a little farther than 2B's length behind your opponent on block. On hit, it crumples the opponent. In pressure, you can rapid cancel at different points to create a left/right mixup\n\nThe D version launches the opponent and can be followed up with a dash 5B/C if the opponent is hit off the ground or even 6C if the opponent is being juggled after 2C for example. It is a staple for extending combos midscreen and it leads to great corner carry. It is the fastest in terms of travel speed, covers the most ground, and is positive on block so it can be used to extend pressure. On normal block it leaves you about a 5B's length in front of your opponent.\n\nYou can microdash into these specials to give them more effective range. This is done by inputting either 2366X, or 412366X. This also makes it somewhat easier to link 236236C.\n",

                        "Description": "\nThe 2nd attack of Tsubaki's 'rekka' combo. It launches the opponent on hit and has body invulnerability a few frames into its startup that last until around until the move becomes active. Unsafe on block, but delivers a sufficient amount of pushback to make you harder to punish. It's too slow to be used reactively or in neutral, so it is mostly just combo fodder. Just like with the 236X series, you can followup with 22D on block to catch people trying to punish you and/or hold onto your turn.\n\nThe regular B version flips the opponent when it launches them. It has short recovery after launching the opponent which makes it possible to followup with 5B/C or 623C and go into a juggle or air combo. However, using this attack by itself requires a couching confirm or the opponent to already be juggled to connect.\n\nThe followup B version does not flip the opponent when it launches them, launches them a bit lower, and deals less damage. Due to the launch being lower (and the recovery of the move being greater) it cannot be followed up with another normal and must be special cancelled into 22B/D in order to continue. Using both the regular and followup versions in a combo will not trigger SMP.\n\nThe regular D version flips the opponent when it launches them and is jump cancellable on hit. The jump cancel opens up a variety of combo paths that all lead to great damage and corner carry. By cjump cancelling the move, you can go into a simple air combo with j.C. By either preforming an IAD j.C or delaying j.C until you are near the ground, you can get a juggle combo going by connecting 5C after touching the ground. The jump cancel can even be used to cancel 214D into a Crush Trigger or raw OD. This technique known as a \"jump cancel cancel\" allows the jump startup of a jump cancellable move to be cancelled into a special move and the paths stemming from use of this technique are where a good number of Tsubaki's big damage combos come from. Just like the B version, it cannot be used out of conventional confirms and requires the opponent to be juggled or crouching.\n\nThe followup D version does not flip the opponent when it launches them, is not jump cancellable on hit, and deals less damage. Unlike the B version, it can still be followed up with 5C even after being special cancelled into which means it can be used to start an air or juggle combo even out of one of the 236X series. If used first without cancelling out of one of the 236X series, the recovery of the move is shorter which makes it possible to followup with 5B/C or 623C and go into a juggle or air combo. However, using this attack by itself requires a couching confirm or the opponent to already be juggled to connect. Has slightly longer body invulnerability compared to the B version that lasts until the active frames instead of just before. Not nearly as unsafe on block compared to the B version. Follows the same rules concerning SMP exemption.\n",

                        "Description": "A new version of the 3rd attack of Tsubaki's 'rekka' combo introduced in CF. It is a versatile special added in CF that helps Tsubaki maintain close-range for pressure while also being a relatively safe potential starter on its own.\n\nThe final attack in Tsubaki's string of special attacks that bounces or knocks the opponent down. Tsubaki leaps forward and swings a hammer overhead, forcing the opponent to block high while avoiding potential lows. It has frame advantage on block and can be used on almost all of Tsubaki's normals, making it a great way to continue pressure as it allows her to close distance relatively easily. Due to its high startup it can be interrupted by a wary opponent, but because of the many options it can be canceled off of, an opponent might be hesitant to call it out.\n\nThe B version hits once with the hammer, bouncing the opponent off the ground. It can be followed up easily with a  large variety of normals with the most common one being 5C. While using it as a way to close distance has its advantages, the opponent may be expectant of this. If the opponent respects Tsubaki's close-range pressure, it may be useful to throw out as a potential mixup at a closer distance. \n\nThe followup B version knocks the opponent to the ground. Without meter it cannot be followed up as the opponent can quickly tech once knocked down. As followups are unlikely, it is typically canceled with 5D/2D. Cancelling into 5D/2D after knocking the opponent down with it speeds up charge generation for a few frames which guarantees a certain amount of a charge after ending a combo, though this can only be done after the B version. As this cancel can be done at the end of a 22B starter combo, it is only recommended for the followup. The accelerated charge speed caused by cancelling this move into 5D/2D generates a minimum of 0.5 charges before going back to the regular charge rate. \n\nThe D version hits twice with the hammer, bouncing the opponent off the ground like the B version, but deals slightly more damage and leaps almost twice the distance. It is roughly the same as 22B in terms of combo routes as the bounce caused is identical, but where it is unique is in how it can be used to make 236X or 214X safe. As these specials are punishable and cannot be canceled into 22B on block, 22D may be able to catch or trade with an opponent looking to punish them. \n\nThe followup D version deals less damage than the regular D version but otherwise functions mostly the same, causing the opponent to bounce off the ground. When used after 214X, the knockup allows 22D to bounce the opponent slightly higher, allowing a unique followup of 3CC for optimal damage in some combos. In some instances, the opponent may be knocked up such that an immediate 22D after 214X will cause 22D to hit only once, but in such a case 22D can be slightly delayed to get in both hits for optimal damage.\n",

It has a lot of recovery making it very easy to punish, so use with caution, especially if you don't have the charge to followup. Has a lot of vertical active frames making it possible to snipe oppponents out of the air if they don't barrier block, but this should not be abused as it is horrible if whiffed or barrier blocked. Not very good to use as an anti air because of the awkward hitbox and the deadzone between Tsubaki and the actual hitbox which allows opponents to sometimes hop over the active portion of the DP and hit Tsubaki who will be stuck in the animation of the DP.\n\nIn CF, the combo routes stemming from this special are emphasized since it can be consistently followed up thanks to it launching both Tsubaki and the opponent fairly low off the ground. For more details, see the  Combo Section\n\nThe C version fires a single pillar upward towards the sky which is actually active the entire time it is on screen. It launches the opponent and can be cancelled into the air specials j.236A and j.214A on hit in order to get a knockdown immediately in front of Tsubaki when she lands. If the move is whiffed or blocked, it can be cancelled into the D versions of those moves in order to make the reversal somewhat safer if called by the opponent. Using j.214D completely prevents a the opponent from scoring a counterhit on you since it replaces the recovery of the DP, but they can still punish you if they are competent, so do not rely on the followups to save you 100% of the time. Using j.236D will move you backward and fire a projectile, but you will still be in counterhit state until you touch the ground.\n\nThe D version fires three small pillars out of the ground and deals slightly more damage than the C version. It is really only used in Mugen combos, but it has utility outside of them. It has slightly more invulnerability and slightly less recovery compared to the C version. It also allows for proper followups after the reversal when cancelling to the D versions of the air specials which are not possibly by using the C version.\n",

                        "Description": "\nTsubaki's aerial projectile special. It also happens to be the second part of her \"rekka\" out of 623C. The projectile is perfect to use in neutral to control movement, shield approaches, and create opportunities to charge. Be careful when using this while higher in the air or when your opponent is nearby because its startup isn't the fastest and it has long recovery. If you are too high up, your opponent can simply walk right under the projectile and it may even disappear before touching the ground since it is only on the screen for a limited amount of time. A handy trick to getting the projectile out safely is to tiger knee the special input (2369A) which makes the special happen right out of jump startup and very close to the ground.\n\nThe A version fires the orb and moves Tsubaki slightly backward while in the air. Its projectile can be used in neutral as stated above and even for oki in the corner (using a certain right combo path). Has combo potential in the corner in conjunction with j.D by linking j.B while the opponent is still in hitstun from the orb. \n\nThe followup A version does not launch a projectile. It's only accessible after a DP, so Tsubaki uses it exclusively as part of a combo ender.\n\nThe D version fires a larger white orb and moves Tsubaki slightly forward while in the air. Although its projectile can be used just like the A version's projectile, it costs a charge so it really isn't worth it. Just like 623D, it sees most of its use while under the influence of Mugen, but when used together, a decent followup combo can come out of a successful reversal. If j.214D is used directly after this special, it will active the aura and change the properties of the move entirely and allow for a stronger followup from an air combo than j.214D by itself.\n\nThe followup D version still launches a projectile. You will see the followup version of this special after a whiffed or blocked DP. It has the same weakness as using 236A high in the air, though; attentive opponents will run right under the projectile and punish you if they are fast enough.\n",

                        "Description": "\nTsubaki's air combo ender and final part of her string of specials starting from 623C. It nets a knockdown and leaves her right in front of the opponent when she lands. In BnBs, this special often follows j.236X. Cancelling into 5D or 2D after grounding the opponent speeds up charge generation for a few frames. This guarantees about 1/2 a stock before going to the regular charge rate. Just like the 22X series, this cannot be done after the D version of the special. If your back is to the corner, it can be used after a super jump to scale the screen and run away from your opponent. Not that great of an idea to use in neutral as an approach or in pressure unless you have the meter to cancel its recovery.\n\nThe A version travels at a -60\u00b0 angle and covers the least distance. The B and C versions travel at a -45\u00b0 angle and a -30\u00b0 angle respectively. \n\nThe regular C version pauses for a moment, then descends. On air hit it wallbounces in the corner but causes soft knockdown. You can use this to set up different oki situations.\n\nThe followup properties can be attained by special cancelling out of either the 623X series or j.236X series. These versions are one of Tsubaki's main combo enders. After getting a hard knockdown, Tsubaki can call out delay techs with 2A to continue a combo and net some corner carry. \n\nThe regular D version descends at the C version's angle. It will always hard knockdown and has longer untechable time. By dashing you can pick the opponent back up and go into another full air combo or end in a super. This move is essential as it allows any air combo to be converted into a ridiculous amount of damage and corner carry from anywhere on the screen. 2A after the post-landing dash is the simplest way to follow up the special, but it doesn't do that much damage and and prorates the combo pretty badly, so if you have trust in your execution you can go for 623C and catch with 5C to continue the combo. Of course, 623C prorates the combo nearly as bad as 5A, but it deals nearly triple the damage that 5A deals.\n\nThe followup D version descends at an angle similar to the regular A version and recovers much slower, so she can't followup on knockdown. This effect is often seen when Tsubaki autopilots 623C > j.214D without confirming the 623C hit.\n",

It can be used in neutral to cover your approaches, control the opponent's movement, or create opportunities to charge just like j.236A. It can be used for oki or pressure as well.\n\nThe A version sends out a pink orb that travels about fullscreen screen before disappearing. It has fairly slow startup, so just like j.236A, it should only be used in neutral when you are a comfortable distance from your opponent. You can also use it against passive opponents to reset pressure. When used this way, you should cancel into it from high attack level moves like 6C or 6B so you don't get mashed out as easily. This reduces the gap of time where you can get mashed. On most knockdowns, you can send out the projectile to cover your opponent's wakeup so they have to block while you run in. This is especially useful after a 2C ender midscreen if the opponent neutral techs.\n\nThe D version sends out a larger white orb that starts out accelerating very slowly before rocketing off the screen similar to Carl's Volante. The large size and its new acceleration make it even better at doing nearly everything the A version's can do. The slow start speed protects the space directly in front of you when it is called out and can be used as a shield. This also improves its use as oki. In neutral, avoiding the projectile is much more difficult and risky for characters that don't have very good movement options. \n\nAll of this utility makes the D version a very acceptable use of charge outside of combos and pressure. In those situations, you are better off using charge on something else. If 236D is used directly after this special, it will active the aura and change the properties of 236D, similarly to the air versions.\n",

It also places you at a good advantage if blocked so you can apply pressure, but you can still lose to DPs and some characters may be able to use their backdash to make it whiff. If the opponent is wary of this combination special, you can send out only 421D's projectile without whiff cancelling into 236D and go for an IAD to punish them trying to bait it. This is also a really good special to use in combos, especially if used in the beginning or in mugen combos as it prorates just as amazingly as the air aura. However, since there are very few opportunities to use this attack, it is not considered so much. When you do come in contact with an opponent they will be launched high enough for you to catch them with 6C even if they were originally on the ground.\n",

Remember that if this is used on your opponent's wakeup they can avoid it by jumping, and this is why you would mix it up by using 5C. 5C is a great combo starter and will hit if opponent try to jump on their wakeup. It's all about conditioning your opponent. There are many setups you can use with this command grab so please check out the strategy guide. \n\nIf you do RC this attack and need to followup, your most common options would be 2C > 214B, 22[D] > 6C, and CT > 6C. \n",

You can link with 236D after the super ends for a short combo, and in other rare cases you can use 3CC or even 6C. The C version does not consume any charge.\n\nThe OD version is also invincible on startup, but Tsubaki ends this version with a shield charge that floats the opponent into the air allowing for followup combos. If you have the meter+stocks, combo 236236C into 236236D for massive damage\n\n195+\n\nDefault super for big damage.\n\nThe D version is your main combo ender because its minimum damage is higher than the C version, and Tsubaki moves forward during the animation making it easier to connect. The D version will consume all the charge you have and have no control over the amount used. If this version is used used during Macto Maledictus (214214D), it will use the amount of charge stock that Tsubaki had on Macto's activation. It does however knock the opponent away from you, which allows you time to charge. If you were facing the corner when the combo ended, you will still have oki since the super knocks them back to the corner and leaves you near them after while in OD.\n",

Very risky to use when your opponent has Burst stocked since the super's animation is a visual indication of certain death for them which will usually end up with you across the screen with 50 less meter and no charges. If you are in OD, however there is no escape and OD benefits Macto by making it last longer. Can also be used to make viewers go \"ooooh\" and \"ahhhh.\"\n",

It can be used from fullscreen as a neutral tool to help Tsubaki get in against zoning characters or to get space to charge against rushdown characters. It can also be used to lock the opponent down and force a mixup upon them after a knockdown. Since it is invulnerable from 16F on, using it after a knockdown will evade any of the opponent's reversal attempts. If it hits you can confirm into j.C for a smidgen of damage and another knockdown. However, it is possible to hit her out of it during start-up when the blades are still coming out, so don't use it like a reversal super. Many opponents like to CA during this super so if they have the meter it is advised to be on the look out and bait it if possible.\n\nWhile in Overdrive, the summoned projectiles change their appearance and fire off slightly slower, effectively locking down the opponent longer. Additionally, they actually hold the opponent in place like Rachel's Tempest Dahlia even if they are in the air or using barrier.\n",

It is strongly advised you do this if they do an overdrive raid on the first hit because it will make the second hit miss and open you up for a punish. In pressure you can jump cancel the first hit and follow up with J.2D to extend your pressure, this is gapless (assuming you did it as clean as possible) on most hitboxes (leaving you at +2 though instead of +3) and leaves a 1-frame gap on shorter hitboxes (Mai, Bullet....) (and leaves you at +3) \n\nWith meter this move can be used for mixups as rapid cancelling the first hit puts you airborne, so you can for a nasty J.A/J.B overhead, you can also wait till right before the second lands and RC into a throw or low.\n\nCuriously, the second part of the move is programmed to only activate when Terumi vertical velocity hits zero, so if some external force launches him upwards (Such as Kokonoe's Gravitron), Terumi will be stuck in recovery from the first part of this attack until he starts falling.\n",

Fortunately, however, Terumi gains so much meter for RCs that this is generally safe to use at short range and can lead to big damage should you call correctly and score a nice counterhit.

When used as a combo ender, however, it can be very hard to punish rolls midscreen, but it can be used to catch rolls on specific combo enders (6C, 22C). \n\nIt can be used as a very gimmicky pressure reset and throw setup by putting the opponent in blockstun and making it whiff.\n\nA major change in BBCF is that this move now has a minimum height restriction; due to this, the move doesn't fully animate on airborne opponents too far from the ground. However, Terumi can follow up with 5A or 5B after hitting an airborne opponent, giving the move corner carry abilities.\n\nIn 2.0 the blockstun on the move has been increased. Making it only -4 on block. This brings it in line with other moves similar to this (Hell\u2019s fang). Be wary of IB.\n\nIt can be used as a safer alternative to 6C to frame trap deeper in your blockstrings since it is much less vulnerable to OD. Make sure you have meter available to RC on block.\n",

Wallbounces towards Terumi midscreen, wallsticks in the corner, and can be used as a corner combo extender, not that good in this version due to CT combos being readily available and the damage/resource gain difference not being that big. Use it to extend combos in situations where CT isn\u2019t an option or if you really need the extra damage.\n\nCan be used to end combos, giving you worse damage than his other supers, but better Oki.\n\nUnder Overdrive, the number of hits increases but both version cannot be followed up, so it is only used as a combo ender.

Part of the trick of this move is that it looks very similar to his normal walk cycle. It is possible to condition your opponent to see this move coming and mix it up with just walking forward. If they try to use a low or throw (which beat venomous bite) you can beat them with 6B. However, the best way you counter this move is simply to wait; At the end of the walk, Terumi will lose his guard point, stand still and shrug his shoulders while still in a counterhit state, allowing them to use the best possible counterhit they have, activate overdrive, pick their nose etc...\n\nAs such, this move is generally way too high-risk to advise using over your other defensive options as it loses to almost everything. Against heavily telegraphed or reactable moves however (such as Tager's charging sledgehammer) you can use it, especially if you have another 50 heat lying around, even moreso with OD, as you can get anywhere from 6-7+K Damage with it (it also almost guarantees active flow).\n\nOD version does increased damage, becomes super-cancelable on a successful counter, and can counter lows. Other limitations still apply, however.\n",

In pressure, it also works as an instant overhead from jump cancellable normals, but it can whiff on characters with a smaller crouching hitbox, notably Nine and Es. j.C itself is pretty unsafe if used on a grounded opponent so you have to do j.C > RC > j.C for safe mixup. The only other option is to special cancel it with j.214B and then drive cancel it for more pressure (unsafe method) or to get away. This is why IOH j.C > RC > j.C is only safe when you have the meter to cover for it. However, keep in mind that this is an instant overhead, so it's highly likely to hit as is. \n\n\n",

This is the normal you should be using if you're air to air with your opponent. wj.A will help to level up your pressure and mixup if you use utilize it with wolf brake (1DCA OR 6D > 4CA).

Pops your opponent straight upwards on hit. Typically you will be using this move to fish for hits. A blocked wolf cannon is pretty unsafe and each character has various ways of punishing you. You can try to make it safe with 7D/4D if it gets blocked, but characters such as Jin can punish 7D followups with 623B. Check the  Combos Section to look at potential followups.\n\nWolf cannons don't have to be used offensively. They also provide another means of wolf movement. They don't cost much more wolf meter to use so it's well worth using it provided you can combine it with followup movements such as 7D > 4C wolf brake.\n",

Wolf version leaves Valkenhayn closer to the opponent after the followup.\n\nValkenhayn charges diagonally downwards towards his opponent then follows up with two more attacks on hit. If the landing attack does not connect then the last hit will not come out. You can also recharge low wolf meter with this ender but not as much as Sturm Wolf because Valkenhayn spends most of this super in the air, halting the wolf gauge. Another important factor to consider is that this should only be used when you're going for the kill as the opponent has the option to roll forward and past you, making you lose any form of oki you had planned. However, there is a way to counter this if you have 100 meter. After a Konig Flug in the corner, at the end of the recovery, input 412364D. This is an option select. If the opponent rolls behind you, Sturm wolf will activate and hit them, but if you're too quick you'll end up in front of them and the attacks will whiff. If the opponent does not roll you'll get a w4D backdash.\n\nThis attack can also be RC'd on the 2nd hit which will make your opponent float in the air for some time. The timing is a little difficult to get used to, but is it useful if you need to get the little extra damage in to go for the kill. \n",

The free Werewolf gauge and forced Active Flow can allow Valk to use his wolf form much more aggressively. Note that while the oki off this move is very poor mid-screen it can give meaty oki if used in the corner, though Valk will need to micro-walk back before attacking in-order to prevent forward rolls from escaping the corner.\n",

Is also used in many crouch confirms to launch when gravity is not available or the opponent is too far for gravity, as 5C 6B always works on crouching except off short starters like 5A/2A. Has no gatlings on hit or block but is safer when used at a distance.\n",

Because this move comes from behind the opponent, they have a clear path to you if they read this and dash towards you before the sword hits them. This move is useful as an overhead, albeit a slow one. Has the same downsides as 5D since it isn't jump cancelable on block, but from there you can cancel it into another sword or special to protect yourself. 4D > 5D is gapless when not super far away and is a safe way to hitconfirm while also keeping safe from moves like Ragna's Carnage Scissors.\n",

The late-chain into itself allows you to be a lot less predictable with your blockstrings, and can level up your pressure from a character whose pressure is only sub-par. Its ability to cancel into throw also allows for deeper mind games.

This move will be seen in nearly every corner combo (And some midscreen ones for the corner carry). It will nearly always combo from 5C regardless of context (Crouching, ch, etc). Some characters will need 6C to be spaced slightly less due to smaller hurtboxes interacting with its dead zone (Particularly wallsplat hurtboxes in corners). 6C can be used in blockstrings as a frame trap or simply to push your opponent farther away and giving you even more blockstun to drive cancel or special cancel into something, but do not forget that this IS a frametrap and always will be without a very precisely timed stein so autopiloting into this is ill advised.\n",

This is especially useful in the corner, because you can get very decent meterless damage off of it. Can be used as a meterless combo ender in the corner, but is generally inferior to stein setups.

SoD is slightly faster than 6c and having frame advantage that is juuuust good enough to make it very hard for most of the cast to punish you outside of close range. In exchange you lose the ability to stein cancel said recovery. Its also exceptionally plus on RC with 2b becoming airtight should they block or lead to nice corner carry and a confirm should it hit.  As for use in combos it ground slides making it great for extending combos near/in the corner. SoD is also a standard ender in many combos including mid screen with some of Mu's more zoning oriented matchups to send them away from you.\n\nCharged: Purely a combo tool. The charged version gives you a wall bounce and a ton of untech time so its found in many corner routes. It should go without saying using this for much else is a bad idea as its both slow and little to no more safe than the uncharged version. Side note that this charged version is often written in combo notation as SoD2 or SOD2 as despite appearances there are no in-between levels of charge, just uncharged and max.\n",

It forces your opponent to block, even when they are hitting Mu after the laser comes out due to the laser aiming at Mu's opponent after it has passed through the last stein. The gaps between 236D and her strings are variable due to placement of steins and which attacks Mu uses to force her opponent to block which could lead to ambiguous mix ups/frame traps.\n\nThis move is best used when Mu is relatively far from her opponent or right as her opponent is knocked down to the ground so she has time to set up the laser as it has quite a bit of startup. The faster laser means less blockstun, and multiple steins are recommended when using this move, to guarantee at least some effectiveness. This does however give it new uses, especially when fighting zoners such as Rachel, to force them to block.\n",
