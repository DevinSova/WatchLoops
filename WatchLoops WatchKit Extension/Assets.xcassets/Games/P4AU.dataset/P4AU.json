Used in some Orgia combos to launch the opponent and continue into an air combo and as a starter for some Mode Change combos. It has some utility in pressure, particularly when baiting reversals and Bursts, since in Orgia, it can be cancelled with Orgia actions as well as jump-cancelled; however, since 5AA leaves Aigis airborne even when blocked, it cannot cancel into any ground attack, leaving Aigis's options on block restricted to a jump normal or an empty jump when not in Orgia, making her pressure much looser and more obvious. Beware telegraphed jump pressure off 5AA.",

Seen in combos that contain Aigis's 5AAAA string. 5AAA's attack whiffs on crouching opponents, so it's not a reliable overhead in pressure. On standing block and hit, Aigis jumps and recovers quite far from the opponent, roughly one-third of the stage away. On crouching block, Aigis jumps directly above the opponent while whiffing the actual attack, recovering near the opponent rather than at a distance and leaving the the opponent free to retaliate. If not in corner, Aigis will cross over the opponent during 5AAA's whiff recovery (in corner against crouching opponents, Aigis will recover crossed up and in the corner if the opponent punishes with a forward-moving button, rolls to force a side switch, etc.). During the aerial recovery, Aigis is vulnerable to AUB attacks, so be cautious. \nIf the opponent changes from standing to crouching guard between 5AA and 5AAA, 5AAA will hit their extended vertical hurtbox as a pseudo-fuzzyguard (i.e., the opponent will be shown as hit high despite visibly standing). However, there's no way to force the opponent to switch their guard like this and such a situation is unlikely to occur in a match, but it's worth noting.",

Special and super-cancellable. j.C is one of the best normals in the game due to its speed, size, utility, and cancel options. However, the move can be low-profiled and the hitbox for both attacks will not connect if done too low to the ground. Aside from its use in nearly every combo, j.C is Aigis's primary way of contesting the spacing game, both in and out of Orgia, as well as creating deadly cross-ups with airdashes, Orgia movement, and airturn. Understanding how to properly space j.C is crucial to playing Aigis well -- if you beeline at opponents with Boost or an airdash into j.C, you will be punished and lose a card, but when spaced well, j.C can be difficult (even impossible) for some opponents to challenge, allowing for high-damage whiff-punishes and combo conversions.",

The A version consumes 9 bullets and hits closer to Aigis while the B version consumes 14 bullets and shoots a significant distance away from Aigis. The SB version also consumes 14 bullets, spread out into two paths of 7 bullets each: one path with the half-screen angle of the A version and another path with the full-screen angle of the B version. When using the A version, there's limited pushback, while the B and SP versions move Aigis further back, allowing for some cross-up gimmicks. As with other specials, there's significant start-up and recovery on this move, making it only situationally useful.",

Unlike in P4A, using 5D or 2D no longer prevents Akihiko from using other Persona attacks (i.e. Akihiko can now pull with 5D, then attack shortly afterwards with 5C). This also counts as a Cyclone move, with each level increasing the speed that the opponent comes towards you. However, you can't cancel into any other cyclone moves after this. This is a vital tool for opponents who try to keep away, as well as a great offensive tool; pulling an opponent towards you and blocking them with your body means they're forced to take quite a bit more offense than they otherwise would due to the negated pushback.  Keep in mind that Caeser is a pretty big target, though, so don't throw this out carelessly against zoners.\nBe sure to use this for oki, especially since you'll be able to catch your opponent by surprise with a sudden 5C if they're close enough.",

A version has less startup than the B version, but travels less and does less damage. SB version travels the most distance, with the same startup as the A version. \nInterestingly enough, Akihiko will only perform the punches if he reaches the opponent's vertical position. This makes it much more safe to whiff if you're not near the opponent, and can even act as a psuedo-dash because of how good of a distance it covers in such short time. However, this doesn't take their horizontal position into regard. If the opponent happens to jump above or over you while you're performing this move and you run underneath them, the punches will come out anyways, making you susceptible to a punish. Use with caution. Still a valuable tool, as this move alone can easily start his offensive game.\nRemember that if you access this through the S Hold system (hold A for at least 135F), you'll have invincibility and can follow up with B Boomerang Hook. Use this during a blockstring to exploit any gaps, but don't be too predictable with it.",

Your opponent will always be able to react to this.\nThe best chance you have to land this is by making your opponent unable to move through Shock, but a Level 3+ Maziodyne is the only way to secure a Shock that covers the duration of this move. Not only does this setup require a grand total of 150 SP, but your opponent still has a chance to escape by means of using an Evasive Action to go through the globe.

To get a Clean Hit, you must hit your opponent with specific spacing. You'll see the word \"CLEAN HIT\" pop up on the screen and the sound effect will be different if you do it right.Besides Clean Hits, Victory Cry still has one more ability: Junpei's HP and SP will regenerate constantly over time. Each time you get 10 Runs (10, 20, 30 and so on), his regen will grow stronger, making him gain more SP and heal more HP over time.\nThis also applies to his damage using the bat during Special Moves/Supers: The more Runs he score, the more damage he'll get.",

Great for catching moves like Mitsuru j.C or Liz J.B however.",

On normal and counter hit, 5B can be gatlinged into Charge Thrust for a combo. Almost every character's sweep low profiles 5B and many 5As can clash with the move's hitbox when timed correctly.On whiff only, 5B becomes a two-hit move: after the animation for 5B, a second strike is performed; this second attack hits higher than the first, at roughly the level of Ken's head. Consequently, 5B can be whiffed to bait jump-ins, as the second strike will often hit opponents out of poorly angled jumps and air-dashes. Characters with high mobility and opponents aware of 5B's anti-air utility can easily punish this tactic and catch Ken during 5B's lrecovery. Additionally, while either hit of 5B can strike airborne opponents, 5B cannot be jump canceled even on hit, making it rather difficult to follow up. Note: 5B is not airtight when chained from an instant blocked A move. Beware of IB reversals.",

Unlike other normals and specials, Koromaru has no recovery on block, so 2C's utility is buffed by the fact that Koromaru is free to act again after the attack.At neutral, it is useful for sending Koromaru running under and then punishing higher-hitting attacks, as well as giving Ken a chance to close distance, start pressure, or begin a combo if 2C hits. On counter-hit, 2C has extra untechable time, making conversions easier. If blocked, the opponent can punish 2C with an air hit into combos, but if Ken is nearby Koromaru can be covered. 2C also has applications as an anti-air due to its speed and large vertical hitbox. In pressure, 2C can be used to cover gaps while also allowing further pressure from Ken. In combos, it is used to launch opponents for a variety of follow-up options.",

Ken strikes the opponent with an upward thrust of his spear that carries him off-screen for a brief time, then reappears a set distance from his takeoff point and performs a second strike. If the first hit whiffs or is blocked, then Ken will not perform the second hit. Extremely rewarding on counter-hit, as Ken can follow up with a sweep or dashing 2B for a full combo, but also extremely risky as the extremely long recovery and lengthy counter-hit state mean that Ken will generally suffer a massive punish for whiffing his DP. On block, Ken can still cancel into supers once he reaches the ground, so Thunder Reign or SB Fire Breath can be used to bait opponents who do not properly hit Ken on the way down.",

If the fire hits the opponent, the instant kill completes for over 57,000 damage. A very fast IK but completely blockable. Koromaru must be on screen in order to use Ken's IK. Like Fire Breath, this move starts from Koromaru's position and not Ken's, so the closer Koromaru is to an opponent, the less time they'll have to react to the IK's animation. Can be used to punish certain supers due to its speed and range.",

Best used very sparingly, preferably when opponents aren't mashing 2A on your wakeup to fish it out. \nOn the plus side, the move will cause a wall bounce on counter hit, allowing you to follow it up with a combo unlike other furious actions.

This is the version usually used for reversals.\nD Version has the gears appear at about 2/3rds of the screen away from Labrys.

However, it can be used to enter Awakening safely at the appropriate distance by first using Margaret's sweep, as the opponent will be forced to block or jump the sweep attack and consequently unable to punish Margaret for the whiffed DP.",

A common use of 214A is to give knockdown from small confirms and perform a safejump afterwards (usually with j.C). For the momentum that these knockdowns deliver, 214A is a very important ender for ground confirm.\n214A is also a useful mixup tool after conditioning opponents with her other high/low options. 214A is generally unsafe on block and punishing will often give opponents a crouching confirm. However, the move can be made relatively safe by spacing the move well and/or using One More! Cancels and Panta Rhei to extend Margaret's pressure at the cost of meter.\nAt neutral, its chest invulnerability can be used to quickly low profile and punish moves with slow recovery such as Mitsuru's 5A. \nA Version (air): A single horizontal attack that extends certain confirms. At neutral, j.214A can serve as a surprise deterrent from directly approaching Margaret in the air.\nB Version: The B version can also be used to provide safejumps with more corner carry; however, it is far more prorated so it will only work for very shortened combos. The most common use of 214B in combo is launching opponents near the corner to finish with an air combo ender.\nB Version (air): Another very important combo ender as it allows Margaret to convert many stray air hits into long range knockdowns. In addition, Yoshitsune hovers high in the air for a considerable period and allows other persona attacks such as 5C and 5D to attack under that location while Margaret is far away.\nSB Version: Quickly travels fullscreen while hitting 3 times. It can be situationally used at neutral to disrupt a slow-starting fullscreen move such as Yu's Ziodyne. \nSB Version (air): Used to provide a better knockdown when j.214B cannot due to proration. Due to its superb recovery, it can also be used to extend small air confirms afterwards into fullscreen combos. In addition, the 3 hits allow Margaret to easily manipulate combos into Hassou Tobi afterwards.",

Loses to most sweeps and low profile specials (Chest invul)\nImportant midrange poking tool for Naoto and is perhaps one of Naoto's best and most consistently used grounded combo starters. It has decent range, largely due to Naoto moving forward during this attack, and combos quite nicely into most things. It is used in pressure to move in closer to the opponent and to create frame traps by delaying cancels into 2B or 5C for example. If you condition your opponent enough, you can even dash up and grab your opponent after 5B on block as a result of this. Should you push yourself far out during pressure and want to go back in, 5B can be dash canceled on hit or block, but this option is somewhat unsafe so be sure to condition your opponent to not expect this first before using. Biggest problem with this attack is that it now has Chest property, which means attacks that have Chest invulnerability such as sweeps, Narukami's Swift strike, etc. can cleanly beat this attack if anticipated properly.

It can be used to mix the opponent up if their reactions are slow, but the main use for this move is to call out B+Ds. Ideally, you'll want to use the armor frames of this attack to go through the opponent's DP and then hit them in their recovery. On block, this move is unsafe so I'd suggest using this move only when you have a good read or have 50 meter to make it safe. On hit, you can confirm into a fairly hard hitting air combo or a very damaging corner combo route that can break 4k meterless.",

The notable thing about this stance is the signficant backwards flip that has a very brief window of full invulnerability. Theoretically, it seems that this flip has roughly the same invulnerability as Naoto's backdash, but this is not confirmed and needs further testing.

This move is NOT a reversal, as the invulnerability does not kick in until roughly frame 4 which means this move will lose to attacks done on the first 3 frames of this move's start up.

This means that your opponent's defensive options are incredibly limited and gives you a Fatal counter starter if you hit your opponent during the time they are afflicted. This move also gives you a hard knockdown that gives strong oki as well as adding insult to injury by removing 6 fate counters. AND if that wasn't enough, you can combo off this attack with more supers or a dashing 5B or Sweep if the proration isn't too high. This move is crazy good.",

There is no difference between 5D and 2D: they block both highs and lows just fine, as well as specials and supers. When blocking, Asterius absorbs projectiles, so a single-hit projectile that connects with a blocking Asterius will disappear upon contact with Asterius rather than continue onward to Shabrys herself. Shabrys is free to move while Asterius is blocking; however, he will always move or teleport to her location on her wake-up. Pressing D once will cause Asterius to block until a command is inputted but system commands using C or D will automatically activate Asterius (for example, rolls, hops, Furious Actions, and throws will all trigger Asterius to attack). Holding and releasing D at precise timings to manipulate Asterius's movements is key to executing certain combos.",

Inflicts quite a bit of damage on hit and gives Shabrys advantage on block. The threat of the attack forces the opponent to quickly stop their offensive to dodge the attack or block it and be put in blockstun. Useful for starting an offensive or punishing opponents for auto-piloting. Can be mashed while blocking at the risk of losing a card, as Asterius will continue the attack while Shabrys blocks if he makes it underground safely, though savvy opponents will notice Asterius's sudden absence. Was 8C in the original Arena. Asterius locks on to an opponent's position sooner in Ultimax.2C is also key to displacing Asterius, as once he emerges, 2C can be cancelled into a special to continue pressure. On hit, the untechable time is significant and the attack can be followed up with a combo. Quickly reacting to how an opponent approaches 2C is important when mounting your offensive and determining whether you're gaining or losing ground.Bracketed values indicate the start-up when used during Titanomachia.",

Very useful for setting up Titanomachia activations or as a quick (but safe) grounded overhead, albeit at the cost of 25 meter.",

On hit, Asterius proceeds to knock the opponent back and forth several times in mid-air, juggling them before finishing by flinging them away. The final hit causes an immediately air-techable wallbounce. Depending on the version used as well as the opponent's positioning, Shadow Labrys and the opponent may switch sides. Public Execution cannot hit grounded opponents (though they can be comboed into the grab in a variety of ways); however, as a command grab, it is unblockable, so airborne opponents must evade the grab once it's active. \nAs a reactive anti-air grab, Public Execution has weaknesses, from its start-up and limited hitbox to its proration, but it truly shines in combos. Despite Public Execution's high proration values, the move has a significant amount of guaranteed untechable time, allowing for extensions into Brutal Impact B or SB. Since the grab cannot be Bursted, its primary use is in max damage and/or kill combo routes to link supers together while locking out an opponent's Burst. Additionally, Public Execution is comboable, whether as a combo starter or mid-combo move, and does high damage on raw hit, making it quite good for tech traps and air combo resets; however, there is no way to force an opponent into any version of Public Execution after airblocking one of Asterius's attacks, so using Public Execution to catch various techs or as a reset is highly situational. \nThe image shows the first hit of Public Execution, which is the grab's initiation and always does zero damage. Asterius's forward distance when beginning the grab differs depending on the version used. All versions have identical proration values; however, the greater the number of hits, the longer the opponent is juggled, giving Shadow Labrys more time to charge and release Brutal Impact B or SB. \nBracketed values are for the Titanomachia version. \nC Version: Asterius appears closest to Shadow Labrys. Start-up is faster than the D version's, slower than the SB's. Hits three times. This version has less utility than the D and SB versions, but can be used when close to the corner to link into Brutal Impact B or SB. On raw hit, it's more difficult to follow-up than other versions, but it can be used as a tech trap or to punish an opponent for jumping out, though beware losing okizeme and positioning, as the wallbounce from the final hit will allow the opponent to tech out of the corner if the grab is not followed up. If cancelled into from one of Asterius's normals, Asterius will begin the grab from his current location, extending the range. \nD Version: Asterius travels forward before beginning the grab, giving it improved range but the slowest start-up of all versions. Hits four times. Combos from 5AAAA and can be followed up without Brutal Impact, though such combos are typically impractical and do less damage than standard routes. With Awakening, Public Execution D is an excellent combo tool, as it creates combo extensions from both Titanomachia and Brutal Impact into a second Brutal Impact for explosive, unburstable damage. The final hit always causes Shadow Labrys and the opponent to switch sides.\nSB Version: Shares the range of the D version with the fastest start-up at the cost of 25 SP. Hits five times. Like the D version, it combos from Shadow Labrys's autocombo, and, again, allows for combo extensions after Titanomachia into both the B and SB versions of Brutal Impact. The SB version is a very strong combo tool due to the grab's untechable time.\nTitanomachia Version: Fastest start-up of all versions. As with the C version, hits three times, but the damage of the third hit is increased. Begins from Asterius's current position. Used in very specific Titanomachia sequences or as a \"surprise\" attack to catch opponents during Titanomachia, though such use should be sparing."

Has deceptively large range and does a good amount of damage with a significant amount of invuln. Unlike in the original Arena, both Shadow Labrys and Asterius are invuln to supers. The attack starts from Asterius's position, not Shadow Labrys, making it useful for punishing and/or sniping an opponent. Cannot be One More! Cancelled or One More! Bursted, so if blocked, expect to be punished heavily. When done in the air, Shadow Labrys jumps forward slightly and can cross-up opponents. \nC: Fastest start-up but highly negative on block. Best used at the end of combos to add damage when the super will kill or as a punish. \nD: Very slow start-up, slightly higher damage than the C version, and slightly less recovery. Much safer on block than the C version. Somewhat less useful at the end of combos than in Arena due to the addition of SB supers, but the D version's start-up and increased invuln allow it to counter certain supers, as well as make certain routes Burst-safe.\nSB: Has the C version's start-up and D's recovery, does the most damage, and floats the opponent on hit allowing for combo extensions and much better set-ups after the super. Links to Brutal Impact A for an unburstable kill combo or the float can be used to continue into an air combo; Challenge Authority SB is even comboable into itself for a round-ender. A very strong super with plenty of applications. Preferable to the C version when the super won't kill due to the SB version providing a stronger safejump and better set-up options with Asterius."

On hit, the finisher launches the opponent to the top of the screen and forces an extended fall, allowing for combos to continue even after Hellflames. However, the flames are a projectile, so opponents who have escaped or evaded a combo can roll the finisher. It's also possible to force a last-moment cross-up by passing through or jumping over an opponent -- the attack must be blocked relative to Shadow Labrys's position, not Asterius's, so an opponent will be hit if they do not block the cross-up correctly. All versions of Titanomachia share the same finisher. Unless the combo is heavily prorated, the untechable time on Hellflames allows for combos to continue.\nOnce activated, Titanomachia has a five-second cooldown period. Cooldown begins immediately after the finisher or after the super is successfully interrupted.\nThe screen darkens (similar to Shadow Frenzy) while Titanomachia is active.\nAt the first superfreeze, an input counter appears above Shadow Labrys's meter. This counter begins at one, signifying the finisher.\nIf activated in the air, landing recovery is added; air activation no longer cancels ground recovery time.\nIf Titanomachia is interrupted, Shadow Labrys loses a Persona card.",

The scooter inflicts spin state on hit, which can lead to some potent unblockable resets if you also have the Muscle Drink out.

All versions of the move now have landing recovery, and have Fatal Recovery.\nThe A version is a fast attack, so it can be used as a risky form of attack or travel in neutral. Can leave Teddie in front or behind the opponent on block, depending on how close he was to the opponent when starting the attack. Either way, it's unsafe on block, so OMCing the attack to make it safe if blocked is preferable due to the Fatal Recovery. The ground version always leads to 5A on a ground CH, allowing a full combo, while air CHs or CHs with the air version launch the opponent into the air. Aside from that, is often used in combos when extra damage is preferred.\nB version is notably slower, but deals more damage and travels further (about 3/4th of the screen). Leaves Teddie a good way behind the opponent, which can make it more difficult for certain characters to punish, but is also more negative on block. Launches the opponent quite far up, making it difficult to follow up on without OMCing or using a super cancel. Also used early on in a combo when proration is low, or as part of Fatal Counter combos, to tack on more damage.\nThe SB version deals the least amount of damage, but is the only version of the move that is safe on block, and it travels the greatest distance (slightly less than full screen). The move now has projectile invulnerability when travelling, making it a helpful tool against zoners. On hit, launches the opponent slightly, allowing relaunches with 2B into an air combo, but due to the high proration of the attack, rarely leads to much."

Burst cancellable on block only.\nTeddie's only super available when Persona-broken.\nTeddie performs an uppercut. On a successful hit, the opponent is hurled high into the air, slowly falling down as a giant Teddie (or Shadow Teddie) charges a large ball of energy. Pressing any button will create a followup attack that causes a wallstick. If done at exactly the right time (around 1-2F of the\u00a0! appearing), the follow up attack is much stronger and causes the opponent to bounce off the walls twice before the wallstick. \nThe version of the attack only affects the initial distance and the damage of the uppercut. A version covers the most distance and has the least initial damage, SB version has the shortest distance and most initial damage. The followup is identical for all versions. The more powerful followup has 1400 minimum damage.\nAs one of Teddie's few reversals, Nihil Hand provides a much needed defensive and offensive tool to Teddie's repertoire. The damage is higher than Tomahawk, but you will likely push the opponent out of the corner unless you have a specific set-up. Your go-to combo ender when you want damage. Whiffing it leaves Teddie very vulnerable, though, and without the resources to One More! Cancel or Burst on block, Teddie is left open to a huge punish. As with any reversal, don't be too predictable when using it.",

It's capable of dealing at least 5000 damage raw, and it can be combo'd into from just about anything. Unfortunately, it has a steep requirement of 150SP, and due to Yu's reliance on meter, it's generally not ideal. Furthermore, screwing up the inputs will force Yu into a whiff animation (that cannot be cancelled). That said, should you find yourself in a situation where you have 150SP, and you have the guts, skill, and determination to pull it off, you should consider using it. Its incredible unburstable damage can win games. \nThe full command for this super: \n214214AB > 5A > 5A > 5B > 5C > 5B > 5C > 5D > 5AB > 214214CD > [2]8CD",

Doing an air-turn j.C extends its range as well, making it very useful in air-to-air combat and halting air approaches. A common tactic in neutral is to do an air-turn back-dash j.C close to the ground, then input 5C, allowing for some surprise punishes or zoning.",

Yukiko also stays still until j.D becomes active, making it very useful at baiting anti-airs. Just like 2D it also Fatal Counters.",

Able to hold button to continue healing and to block projectiles.\nUniversal DP, though Yukiko's has several notable features. Once active, if the opponent is hit, a low-damage attack will be performed, leaving the opponent across the screen. While Dia is not particularly damaging, it does create quite a bit of distance between Yukiko and an opponent, and if near the corner, the opponent will be knocked into the corner, allowing Yukiko to begin offence. Dia is completely invincible until after active frames. As with almost all other DPs, you can cancel Dia into a super on hit or block. However, the move is very unsafe on block or whiff, has poor horizontal range, and is fairly slow, so use cautiously, as with any reversal.\nAdditionally, you can hold B+D and Yukiko will continuously heal herself until button release. Dia will block all projectiles, regardless of their strength, for the duration; this includes Teddie's Amagiya buckets, Narukami's Zio and Ziodyne, Yukari's 5B and 2B, etc. However, while Dia nulls projectile damage to Yukiko herself, the projectile attack is considered to have been blocked (not whiffed), so an opponent retains all \"on block\" cancel options (such as One More! cancels, jump and dash cancels, etc.). Additionally, you may only hold Dia for 15 seconds per round; after the limit has been reached, you will no longer be able to extend the length of Dia, though you are still free to use it as a DP.\nWhile Dia does cause Blue Life damage to Yukiko, like all Furious Actions, it is possible to negate this by extending Dia to recover life. If you successfully hit the opponent with the attack and continue to hold B+D, you may gain enough HP to offset the 4.5% HP transformed into Blue Health, effectively giving you \"more\" heath.",

This fire setup will explode when the button is released, causing a single hit of fire damage. Due to the fact that you can choose when to detonate the fire, this allows Yukiko all sorts of interesting combo, mixup, and pressure tricks. A typical strategy is to finish a combo with this move, then allow the opponent to tech without detonating the fire. This way, you can use the threat of the fire to allow you to setup mixups, or give you breathing time to setup keep away, or allow for you to use Fire Boost. In this version, Konohana Sakuya will attack next to Yukiko regardless of where she was before Agi was casted, making it less useful in long range pressure. Agi also got changed in that holding the fireball for certain period of time will cause it to detonate twice, making it easier to confirm or set up unblockable situations. Lastly, the fireballs are slightly higher than they were in P4A.\nA Version: The initial hit does not push the opponent away very far, and the fire is setup just in front of Konohana Sakuya. Useful for combos and pressure where you want to keep the opponent close to you.\nB Version: The initial hit knocks the opponent back, the whole way across the screen, and the fire is placed at almost full screen distance, in front of the opponent. Not nearly as strong as it was in P4A since the fireball is not directly on top of the opponent but still Useful for combos or keep away, where you want the opponent as far away from you as possible.\nSB Version: Much slower start-up but is highly advantageous on block and sets up two fireballs instead of one, one for each button. This move has changed drastically compared the other versions, as only one fireball tracks the opponent's position, with the other fireball being at the position A Agi would be. Those who were used to P4A's SB Agi might need to adjust as the fireball that tracks is the B fireball, making it very possible for the B fireball to be closer. SB Agi combos and set ups are still useful but will require adjustment due to the changes. Due to its slow start-up it does require certain confirms in order for SB Agi to hit.\nAir Versions: More or less identical to the ground versions, except they have less recovery.

You can also detonate it by holding C or D as you use Maragi and then release the button to detonate it, although it must be done when you use the move, otherwise the only way to manually detonate it is to press C or D. The fire column has a very large vertical hit-box, does very substantial damage, and causes a very long amount of hit stun. The hit-box, along with being able to manually detonate the wave, allows Maragi to be used as a powerful zoning and anti-air tool. And due to the damage and hit-stun it causes, it can be very powerful for starting combos, and being used in the middle of them. Very good special move overall, but the slow start-up is something that must be considered when using it. It also can be at very large frame advantage on block, depending on how close it is blocked to Yukiko, so it can also be useful for starting pressure or mix-ups.\nC Version: Projectile travels slowly. Slower start-up, but faster recovery. Travels much more slowly in P4AU, allowing Yukiko to keep in pace with it. \nD Version: Projectile travels quickly. Faster start-up, but slower recovery. Good against opponents that are far away from you but dangerous if used up close due to Fatal Recovery.\nSB Version: Fires both C and D versions at the same time. You can detonate each of the waves by pressing their respective buttons. Has the same startup as the D version would but has faster recovery than the C version.

This causes the next Fire Damage based move used to become unblockable. Fire Break will remain ready until Yukiko uses it, but after using an unblockable move, she will have a 15 second cooldown during which she cannot use Fire Break again (time remaining indicated by a meter above her SP bar). In P4AU she no longer gets Blue Life when using Fire Break.\nNote that moves already on screen DO NOT gain the unblockable property. Fire Break will take effect on the NEXT fire attack used. If an Agi is setup AFTER Fire Break is used, that Agi will have the unblockable property once released, but the cooldown timer will immediately begin as soon as the Agi is placed.\nWith her new auto-combo and other new moves, Fire Break is even more dangerous than it was before. When you have Fire Break active opponents will start to be more cautious and attempt to minimize the benefits you get from Fire Break, such as avoiding the auto-combo reset or forcing you to use your charge on something less powerful. Regardless, it is a very powerful tool in Yukiko's arsenal and you should have it up when you can. Note that it has Fatal Recovery, so make sure you cast Fire Break when you know you won't get hit.",

By holding any button you can prolong the spin until she launches the fireball finish. It is now possible to move Konohana-Sakuya around as she spins, so if you perform this move while on Fire Break, it'll be hard for the opponent to deal with. It has invincible startup frames so you can use it punish certain moves, supers, and even Instant Kills.\nC Version:This version is slower and is grounded. Useful in the corner as the hit-stun from the fireball allows you to set up 2D or Fire Break. Unlike P4A, if the opponent is on the other side away from Agidyne, the fireball no longer tracks to the enemy's position and will instead just release the fireball on the side it is on. \nD Version:This version is faster and takes her opponents upward when it hits. The move does not take opponents upward when blocked or if it whiffs, making Yukiko vulnerable to any counter attack if it misses. As such, it is generally not used outside of finishing combos.\nSB Version:It functions mostly the same as the C version except that it throws two fireballs instead of one.

Just like in P4A, Yukiko calls upon her Persona to summon a lethal myriad of cherry blossom petals to whisk her opponent into blissful oblivion. Has slightly more horizontal range now, and because of that fact, it is no longer possible to IK an opponent who reversal bursts right next to you. In order to fully IK the bursted opponent, now you will have to make sure you are spaced well away from your opponent (within 5A hitbox range) for it to work. The move is still useful for punishing moves with long recovery such as Rise's Furious Action and Kanji's A+B (sweep).",
