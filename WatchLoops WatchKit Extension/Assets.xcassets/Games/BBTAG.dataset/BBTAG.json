Can only be canceled into Cross Raid if Ragna has a full Cross Gauge and his partner is currently in the back line (cannot be super canceled in Resonance Blaze).

This move has fantastic scaling as a starter, leading into high damage with only one stock of Skill Gauge, although such a starter is unlikely as it is locked behind 5B, meaning that this typically only occurs after a frame trap.

Very slow, making it a poor choice for Cross Burst punishes as the opponent will recover from their Cross Burst before it hits. In return, the ground bounce on hit makes it very easy to convert into a combo, including moves that normally have too much start-up to be practical. Some characters can even call this assist then use their Reversal Action to anti-air which results in Ragna keeping the opponent in hitstun long enough for the point character to convert the hit into a full combo. Note that doing so will remove the Reversal Action's invulnerability so only do so if the opponent is up-backing out of pressure. Very easy to loop into and from during Cross Combos though the lengthy start-up reduces the number of loops that can be done, especially if the Cross Gauge wasn't full at the beginning of said Cross Combo.",

If the opponent is both high enough and in the corner, Ragna can combo after this move with either 4A or 5A, allowing him to combo into another super.

By using Resonance Blaze Carnage Scissors as a combo extender, as well as using EX Dead Spike as many times as a combo allows, this Distortion Skill can end combos with massive amounts of damage and lifesteal.",

Since he lacks any other grounded overheads and tiger-kneed EX Hizangeki can only lead into a combo if it is done in the corner, Jin must use this move if he wants to mix-up opponents without a partner.

The freeze doesn't last long so only moves as fast as his 5B will combo off of it. If the enemy thaws out they will be left in a standing position. This means that this throw can be used to create reset opportunities with lows, overheads, cross-ups, and even another throw. Note that the opponent can reversal through any of these options so consider baiting them or just taking the guaranteed damage via a combo. Both forward and back throws do the same thing with slightly different animations.",

Fully invincible reversal that is also his only air unblockable move, making it a good anti-air, even more so if he has assist available for a full combo conversion. The follow-up attack always occurs regardless of whether it hit or not, however the timing of the attack changes if Jin manages to hit an opponent in the air, resulting in the attack coming out late. While this is a good thing in most cases as it helps the follow-up connect properly, if the initial attack hits at max height then the follow-up will always whiff. That being said, it has enough untech on the first hit that even if the second hit doesn't combo you are safe from a punish. Combine this with Jin's far reaching, fast air normals and his myriad projectiles to make it very difficult for the opponent to dictate the neutral.",

Fantastic reversal super that is surprisingly safe on block, even being plus in some cases while doing a fair amount of chip damage. Has massive push-back on hit or block which is good for keeping the opponent at a distance. Can also punish zoning as the projectile has unlimited hits and will consume all regular projectiles while ignoring others. May result in a trade as this move has very few frames of invulnerability. In Resonance Blaze, this move deals significantly more chip damage and gains a follow-up attack that greatly increases the final damage and provides safe-jump oki even if the initial projectile only hit once. Higher RB levels means more chip damage and additional meter and passive meter regeneration with which to use this move. It's only downsides are its projectile property making it susceptible to projectile invincible moves and its low minimum damage, most notably on the final hit of the follow-up with its abysmally low .044% minimum damage scaling.",

Instead, Lotus will automatically detonate on hit, allowing for a followup if you're swift since lightning no longer stuns the opponent. Lotus remains on swap, so throwing out Lotus to force your opponent to block while Rachel swaps out isn't a bad idea. This also allows Rachel ample time to approach, set up, drop George, etc. If the opponent blocks these in the air, Rachel can call an assist and throw out her DP for an easy unblockable.",

You can OTG opponents after hitting them from a low height which can reward a full combo, though the timing is a bit tricky. When combined with an assist, Agito can make for a pretty useful cross-up.\nHakumen recovers very quickly after this move, allowing you to do more air moves if done from normal jump height or higher. This can be useful for delaying your fall slightly to avoid an anti-air attack. Another use of the recovery is for safejump setups, as an Agito ender from a certain height will allow you to airdash before landing and fall towards your opponent.

Will throw the opponent over Hakumen's head and slam them on a successful counter, allowing for a combo. Useful for catching bursts since it can cancel off of anything except supers. Since the move can be punishable if not triggered, it can be a good idea to use an assist at the same as Yanagi to make up for the recovery, but do be careful using this since your partner can get hit. It is fairly hard to punish if the opponent isn't expecting it due its unique animation (it doesn't look like a DP or Yukikaze) and short recovery, so it can be fairly safe if used sparingly, especially if the opponent doesn't know the matchup (or you're playing online).",

However, if you cancel into the astral, it will become a strike attack and activate as if the counter triggered, giving you the win regardless. The strike attack has a very large range, but it isn't full screen. It will whiff on targets near the maximum range of Hakumen's 5B, and it will also whiff on targets that are completely knocked down (even if they're still in hitstun). The counter version includes throws and unblockables, which you can bet a lot of players won't see coming. Strangely, the counter does *not* trigger on projectiles. Instead, it eats the projectiles without triggering, likely leaving you vulnerable to a hard punish.",

It can be used to set up left/right mixups by having the assist hit just before or just after Nu switches sides, or simply to safely get close enough for a high/low mixup with jC or 2A/2C. \nNote that all cancels into this version of Act Parser are negative on block, so without the aid of an assist Nu can't use Act Parser to get a guaranteed mixup (although sometimes you can catch people sleeping and cancel a random 5B into Act Parser then throw). The one exception to this is an anti air normal (usually 2B or its followups) cancelled into forward Act Parser; in this scenario, even though the opponent recovers before you, they may not be able to land and press a fast grounded normal faster than Nu-13 can press 5A."

The fast startup can easily catch your opponent off guard, but beware of its short range.\nLinks into 5C, making this move akin in damage to a standard non-super command grab.

Most commonly, you'll see the following normals or chains of normals leading into this super: 5A, 5AA, 5A > 2C, JBBB, or any throw. \nUsually, if your partner is still alive, then you should use partner skill instead of Jayoku if the damage has prorated too much.\nDeals even more damage in Resonance Blaze while still having low P1. Confirming off from 5AA>2C>236+BC in corner and ending it with 2C>214+BC, as an example, nets you with at least 10k damage.\nIf you have enough bars, then at the end of the combo, you can do (2C > (some special) > Jayoku)*n > Mizuchi, creating a Hazama Airline, which will only let you go when you're dead.",

Why? Because you delay the follow-up since you have a window to perfom the follow-up.\nThe oki you get from this is that you reach the ground at the same time as the opponent perfoms an automatic ground tech, which gives you the opportunity to run forward and meaty with 5A on opponent back tech, or backdash and still get meaty 5A or throw (even on 5f mash!) on opponent forward tech.

Unlike jumping attacks, you cannot \"fuzzy\" with the standing unblockable hit against blockstun because if the opponent is considered to be switching guard during blockstun (either crouch-to-stand or stand-to-crouch), Sirius Jolt simply whiffs completely instead.\nYou want to use this move only after conditionning with non-juggle 5BB > 5C standing reset as a layer 2 (layer 3 being jump cancelling out of 5BB to bait dp). 5BB > 236C is a 5f trade in your favor since the wall bounce still occurs.\nNote: this special is trash in combos as it scales everything and can mostly only be used as a low starter that is unsafe on block.\nFull (technical) explanation:There's something that causes the lv5 unblockable hit to only happen when opponent is in standing (or transitioning to/from standing) state, and if it's satisfied, then the lv4 weak hit doesn't happen\nThe Lv5 hit also follows the rule of Unknown11061, which prevents the hit from connecting if opponent is in crouching state or if opponent is transitioning from crouch to stand or vice versa during blockstun (this flag is also seen on Ragna's GH followup, Noel/Es command grabs, and Yukiko 6P, among others, and behaves the same there)\nUnfortunately in the case that both 1 and 2 are satisfied, the weak hit still doesn't happen, so Sirius Jolt just outright whiffs due to the rules of 2.",

One very good aspect is that he either pushblocks you and has meter gain penalty (which is a huge mitigation of resonance regen) or he wastes resonance time.\nYou can charge the final punch for a frametrap (214AA~C).

When well spaced, it's a great way to close the gap in neutral. On hit, you can link 5A to convert it into a full combo. On block, you can start pressure instead.\nMuch like the other versions of Cosmic Ray, EX Cosmic Ray is vulnerable to people jumping so make sure to time this for when your opponent is playing more grounded or when they're landing from jumping around.",

Infinite Rush does multiple hits on block or whiff, moves Makoto forward as she does it and travels 80% of the screen. These are really good for multiple reasons. In neutral, the multiple hits are very good for either confirming into a combo or locking down an opponent so you can dash up and starter pressure, especially when used in combination with tactics your point character can use. \nIn pressure, the multiple hits are useful for locking down an opponent to allow you to go for one good mixup. Because Makoto moves forward such a great distance during the skill, it's both resilient against pushblock and good for keeping an opponent locked down so you can dash back in after being pushblocked out. Unlike other lockdown assists like Jin 6P or Chie and Kanji's 4P, it doesn't pushback the opponent when they pushblock it midscreen either so it's pretty useful anywhere on the screen for your pressure. \nIt's also nice for combos since the final punch of Infinite Rush is untechable until the opponent touches ground. Combined with the multiple hits, you'll have plenty of time to follow up your combo with whatever you desire. However, it only hits closer to the ground so keep that in mind. For opponents that are more airborne when you need to extend your combo, consider doing Makoto 4P instead.",

It has extremely late head invulnerability so anti air attempts need to be done earlier than most and much like 5A comes with a nasty hurtbox that can get counterpoked. This is her main way of going into her B autocombo outside of combos since it is whiff cancelable\n5BB- Auto crossup at close range and projectile invincible it is pretty much the only followup used on whiff during her B autocombo, there is however no way to go into this move gaplessly without having an assist ready to cover her\n5BBB - Auto combo ender, on hit it will always transition Celica into a healing animation if it is not special canceled, used in combos mainly to start 214A loops",

She does the A then B version, however unlike when used on point they do not combine. The two projectiles can severely limit your opponent's options on the ground and are perfect opportunity to approach and close the gap between you and your opponent. This can be very helpful to improve your partner's neutral, especially in some matchups and for some partner characters lacking neutral tools. However, it does have a bit of startup on it though so be wary about using this too close to your opponent. Try to aim to use this further out to avoid both Es and you getting pinned down by rushdown. \nIt can also be good for pressure. The 2 Breunor projectiles provide a good amount of blockstun for you to reset pressure or potentially go for a mixup depending on your character and the situation.",

Mai can still make use of this with assists that have longer startup, such as Waldstein 6P, to avoid this penalty. Certain assists can also set up a sandwich against your opponent if blocked if they last long enough to leave Mai plus on block after her DP, such as Vatista 5P \u2014 if done close to the opponent, Mai will crossup, a very useful situation in a blockstring as losing the DP properties won\u2019t matter in those situations. Can also be used at the end of combos in the corner such as relaunch 2A 5A 2B A+D to set up a safejump, as hitting your opponent when they are higher in the air gives Mai more frame advantage compared to hitting a grounded opponent.",

Be careful, as an opponent can block this move in the air if they see this coming, which will avoid the grounded hit and cause the move to become unsafe. If hitting the opponent in the air by initiating the attack when under them, it reduces the time Mai takes to land on the ground by a few frames, which she can use to pick up the opponent off the ground with a 2A.

Unlike previous entries where Raging Lion was a special move that had a light, heavy, and EX version which each had different properties in the air for a grand total of six variations, Yu now only has the heavy versions in 5BBB and j.C. It is used in combos to bring airborne opponents to the ground to end them with Swift Strike or Cross Slash, providing both fantastic corner carry and oki. Using EX Zio after Raging Lion puts opponents into the corner allows Yu to act freely as Izanagi covers all possible tech options, making it easy for Yu to shut down any wake-up attacks. However, it is difficult to use this move as a mix-up tool if assists are unavailable, as Raging Lion is very unsafe on block. Note that the 16 frame start-up is misleading for ground blockstrings as it doesn't account for a jump's start-up frames.\nExpand for j.C Height Diagram",

Landing this super \"backwards\" on an airborne opponent by using Yu's forward step during the move leaves him close enough to follow up with 2B. While this can serve as a potential match ending combo, unlike in Arena, BBTAG's combo timer system stops combos from lasting too long regardless of whether or not all hitstun has been used. By the time the super's animation is over, Yu will barely have enough time for 2B into either Big Gamble or another Cross Slash. A short air combo can be done but only if the super landed really early on. It's still a valid option to keep in mind, but not something that should be relied upon: Yu can easily deal much higher damage and use less meter by utilizing more practical combo routes.\nWhile the enhanced version can also be followed-up, the longer animation eats up more of the combo timer. Because of this, the potential to followup is weaker than the base version. However, the extra meter from Resonance Blaze makes it easy to follow-up with a 2B into another Cross Slash. This technique can earn clutch wins if used capitalized on correctly, but it's still not something that should be relied upon much.A hitbox fit for a king(pin).",

The move has long start up but you recover before the active frames end! An example block string to set up this mix up point would be 5AA > jump cancel > j.C. If the opponent did not anti air your jump cancel they will be blocking j.C while you're falling to the ground, this gives you the option to either fall down and hit them low with 2A or air dash towards them right before landing and hit them high with j.A. As the move is active after you recover, it's possible to use it in neutral as a sort of wall.

Free air combo)\nShort horizontal, mediocre vertical hitbox, plus a persona move, which makes it even riskier to throw out\nHeals 60 hpf for 18 frames (1080 hp), then 30 hpf (1800 hps) for remainder; Yukiko is forced to \"hold\" Dia for 21 frames minimum\nYukiko's DP. Very unsafe if blocked. It nullifies all projectile attacks and briefly physical attacks (startup only) before knocking the opponent back and granting Yukiko substantial healing time. Dia itself does find use as a tool that can rewards Yukiko after a knockdown, if her opponent is far away, or if they're unable to close in on her right away. Can also be used offensively as a combo ender, disrupt Cross Bursts, and even denies DHCs (UNLESS the DHC is not a projectile, in which case Yukiko WILL be punished). Depending on the right partner (i.e. Waldstein, Hyde), Yukiko can nearly fully heal herself during a match!\nWhen covered by an assist, particularly projectiles, Yukiko can safely tap Dia. The further she is from the opponent and the more cautious the opponent is can determine how long she can reasonably hold for. Utilizing Reject Guard in combination with an immediate assist call can be a decent way to find room to use Dia.\nDia's projectile invulnerability allows Yukiko to be something of an anti-zoning zoner, as she can avoid any (and every) projectile while healing at the same time.\nTake care when using this, as Yukiko can get punished while she's recovering. A simple tap leaves little room for worry, but if held down for too long and the opponent recovers fast enough, Yukiko is left wide open. Make sure you're on the same footing as your opponent when considering this move, if not faster yourself. \nFinally, because Yukiko levitates during the state, she cannot be thrown or command grabbed out of it.",

Offers a ridiculous amount of chip damage during Resonance Blaze, but leaves Yukiko wide open, so be mindful of the distance between you and the enemy and see to it they don't have a means to punish from said distance.\nIt is recommended that a Yukiko player spends time learning every other characters' blockstring consistently and thoroughly, so that they'll have a better awareness of when to use this move; Agidyne can be a highly rewarding, yet highly risky move (outside of comboing, of course).\nDepending on the partner, an early DHC will allow the partner (examples are Weiss, Nine, Aegis etc.) to follow-up while Agidyne is still in motion.\nAn interesting thing to note is that Agidyne completely beats Tager's 5B in every regard, even if he holds it to max length.",

It does a lot of chip damage at high fire boost levels and in resonance blaze: about half of most characters' life bars with level 9 fireboost and resonance level 4. Resonance Blaze also gives Yukiko the 6 bars she needs in order to combo uncharged Maragidyne into charged Maragidyne into Agidyne. If you have a low fireboost level, you can make the opponent block the uncharged version of Maragidyne and fireboost a few times while the opponent is stuck in blockstun from the flames.

It also has significantly greater range than his command grabs and can also pick which side the opponent is thrown, helping Kanji get corner oki. Unfortunately, this grab is very unique in that irregardless of the distance from the opponent, the time it takes to grab is fixed. This means when Kanji throws while the opponent uses a reject guard, the opponent can potentially up back or tech the throw, unlike other characters who grab based on proximity.  As of patch 2.0, Kanji\u2019s grab is more in line with other characters and no longer has a fixed grab timing.",

The real strength of his DP is that if an opponent's physical attack connects while Kanji's DP is active, they will be electrocuted regardless of the distance between them. This makes his DP's hitbox fairly flexible so long as the opponent commits to a non-projectile option. It's also a relatively good anti-air as it beats opponents trying to use jump-ins, cross-ups, or empty-jump lows or throws. Both the raw attack and the counter version are air unblockable as well. If this move counter hits an opponent at its max vertical height or the opponent triggers the counter at a high enough elevation, Kanji can convert the hit into 4A for a full combo. Wary opponents can bait out this move and punish the recovery by out-spacing or by guarding on the ground so use it carefully.",

After the 6 frames of start-up (and the additional 2 frames if the opponent isn't within immediate grab range) and the super freeze occurs, the move has zero frames of further start-up so if the opponent is in throw range they cannot do anything to avoid it. However, this is Kanji's riskiest reversal due to the two bar cost, high recovery on whiff, and poor range so don't use this predictably.",

Teddie also recovers much faster, letting this skill truly shine in combos. Teddie can get out items lighting fast and recover fast enough to loop 5BBB>214C into another 5BBB, which is key to getting higher damage on Teddie. 214C also works better than 214B as a means of creating a Throw setup after a j.A crossup when you have meter to burn.",

The warp is very fast, and Teddies hitbox is active as soon as he pops out of the TV, making for a very ambiguous left/right mix.

If it connects, The opponent will fall inside of Kintoki-Douji's hatch as Teddie tosses in some explosives. Kintoki-Douji then rockets off into the sky and lets loose an impressive display of fireworks.This move saw a huge buff compared to its P4A counterpart, as the screen now freezes during Teddie's dance, and Kintoki-Douji has a hitbox on himself while falling as well as creating a \"shockwave\" hitbox when he hits the ground. This move grants Teddie instant victory on hit, but is punishable on block and costs all of his meter, so use with caution. Easy to combo into with 5BBB, Throw, and Bearscrew.",

It's also his best practical starter, having both good damage and scaling.

Continuous boosting will consume up to one extra bar of orgia before being cut off.\nThe dash speed starts at average run speed, then accelerates slightly at the end before cutting off.\nStarts pressure, extends pressure, creates conversions out of thin air, gives her neutral options, and is just a faster way to move than her regular run.

The hitbox only exists at and below Aegis' arms; cannot hit targets above her.\nGimmicky reversal option with slow startup that has corner carry, and the long animation can give you time to recharge Orgia. Note: you can do 66j.B after as a safejump, but it's never meaty, so your opponent can chicken guard or even 4P to punish it.\nEnhanced version has hard knockdown on the final hit, giving you the time to do whatever you want for oki.",

Unburstable attack, but followups after it are quite limited. With good timing, it's possible to follow up with Heat Riser anywhere, regardless of combo timer decay. If hitstun hasn't detoriated too much, assists can be used during or after Heat Riser in the corner to follow-up (or midscreen with a wide hitting assist such as Elizabeth's 6P) but otherwise this move sees little late-combo usage.\nIf you're close to the corner, you can link this into Demonic Cross Slash. Atom Smasher is doable as well, but it's harder, though it can be done anywhere on the screen to compensate (after the first hit and with not too high hitstun decay). It's also special-cancellable into Maziodyne (air version), but that doesn't lead to much damage and allows the opponent to airtech.\nBecomes much more threatening (espicially against air approaches) when used in Resonance, however, as it will allow confirming Heat Riser into Atom Smasher or even IK in LVL4 Blaze.",

On the plus side, the huge range is advantageous when defending against grounded blockstrings as not many grounded normals can strictly outspace Waldstein's reversal. Also has fairly short overall animation time so you can make it safe by throwing out an assist first. Can be hit confirmed from the long range knockdown from 5AAA (but not the close range restand).",

Gordeau slams his scythe into the ground then jumps while spinning it above his head, following-up with an overhead slash back into the ground. One of the slowest shoryuken-like reversals in the game at 21 frames of start-up, making it highly susceptible to safe-jumps. While Aim Opening has a deceptively large hitbox, it isn't very good as an anti-air as it doesn't reach very high vertically and even if it does catch an opponent he will need a very slow assist that can pick them up after Gordeau does both Aim Opening and Precise Aim. Not usually used in ground combos due to this move's poor oki options but this is his only choice for ending air combos. Has decent minimum damage which makes it good for finishing off opponents without burning meter.",

Gordeau does Mortal Slide into Shade Harvest. If Mortal Slide hit, he will continue into A Grim Reaper, a scythe uppercut, an air Assimilation (which drains meter), an aerial kick, Mortal Glide, and finally the follow-up hit of Precise Aim. If only Shade Harvest hit the opponent or either attack was blocked, they will be dragged towards him and Gordeau does nothing else. Has the same start up and frame disadvantage as Turbulence while having more horizontal range and being significantly safer on whiff, making this Gordeau's go-to reversal super. Grants safe-jump oki against 11 frame start-up reversals. Final frame advantage on hit becomes notably worse in RB, preventing any sort of safe set-ups. If either super will K.O. the opponent, use this one as it steals meter and refunds a small portion of the meter it used.",

Use it finish off low health opponents or to get safe-jump oki, though note that the frame advantage is slightly lower than the solo version so reversals with 10 frames of start-up or faster will stuff the set-up.

Only 5A and 2A can be jump canceled on block.\n5A has great use in pressure has Mika due to its fast startup and ability to be jump canceled. This move is also a great defensive tool as many jabs are, however it's range is pitiful, and using it as a starter will gimp her damage rather severely making it a less than stellar button in neutral.

Has a diagonal hitbox that hits both in front and behind Ruby. Very good at stuffing cross-ups but very poor at catching opponents in the air directly in front of her, which hurts her as this is Ruby's only air unblockable move. In exchange, this is one of the easier reversals to extend via preemptive assist calls due to the lower than average endlag and high hitstun. Very unsafe on block so don't use this carelessly. The height the opponent was at when they get hit by the final hit alters this move's frame advantage. Against grounded opponents the oki provided is very basic, but at max height Ruby can perform a safe-jump set-up.

Note that the gap between the scythe swing and the gun shots is enough for opponents to jump out, leaving Ruby wide open to a counter attack so don't use this move carelessly in block strings. Great for Active Switchs as the partner character can move in under the cover of the shots or confirm into a combo from if Ruby successfully hit the opponent.

Reaching even further than her 2C.\n4~12 BP Armor\nDue to Yang's limited normal ranges, throwing 5B out in neutral for both offensive and defensive reasons can be a strong option, as it can apply pressure if close enough as well as eat through body-attribute attacks that have longer ranges than hers. The armor on 5B only applies to body-attribute attacks however, so it's ineffective against most of the lows and overheads in the game. \nYang's main options from 5B when connecting with the opponent are essentially 5BB, 2C, 214A, 214B, 236X, and jump-cancel, making it a key branching point for a lot of her offense.\nSince the vast majority of the Reversal Actions in the game have body-attribute, Yang has the potential to safely plow through such reversal options. However, as the armor on 5B does not come out frame 1 and the startup and active frames of Reversal Actions generally come fairly late, 5B cannot be used as a meaty when attempting to beat Reversal Actions, nor to directly challenge them. A certain delayed timing is thus required to manage Reversal Actions after knockdown, but with this delayed timing the opponent has the potential to counterhit or throw Yang before 5B can come out.\n5B has the potential to armor through various Distortion Skills, but this is much more limited. Certain Distortion Skills, such as Gordeau's 236BC, have enough startup after the superflash that Yang can 5B on reaction. However, the faster startup of most body-attribute Distortion Skills do not offer Yang this luxury. As a result, unless 5B was already started before a Distortion Skill, which is essentially uncontrollable, it is not very likely to go through one.",

This is particularly strong against opponents that disrespect 2A's range or cannot react with appropriate lows.\nIf within range, 2A can be canceled into 5AA, which allows her to cancel back into 2A and then another 5A cancel, allowing her to greatly extend her normally relatively short pressure. While making her pressure less predictable, this does require being within range for 5A in the first place, so being mindful of ranges is necessary when not in Semblance.",

Similar to pressure situations, calling an assist will allow Yang to combo after a successful hit, and keep her safe in case the j.C is blocked.\nOn defense, the normal is also decent enough to Fuzzy j.C with (17BC1) to steal your turn, granted you get a good read on when there's a gap in your opponent's pressure/your opponent will try to grab you.",

So long as the opponent isn't grounded or not too high in the air, it can be used before and after most Distortion Skills and come out on top. \nSimilarly, it can even be used on reaction to punish high recovery projectiles such as Vatista's and Naoto's 236A even after blockstun, but the timing for this is strict and not for the faint of heart. Conversely, it also works well against high startup projectiles such as Jin's 236B or Vatista's 214C/j.214C, though with good reactions even faster projectiles can be punished. Certain options like Aigis's 236X which inflict a high amount of blockstun and have low recovery after can be punished by canceling blockstun with Reject Guard.\nWhen being pressured, Reject Guard into Burning Gold can be a costly though highly rewarding and threatening option. It forces the opponent to stray away from predictable and/or high recovery pressure options which for most characters tends to be their 5AAA and/or 5BB. While this is less effective against players/characters that do not commit to such options, against those that do it is a serious threat that the opponent must learn to respect. Wary opponents may stagger their pressure with normals that have low recovery and blockstun to both avoid Reject Guard as well as large gaps that can be punished by Reject Guard. Even more wary opponents can cancel into their own Distortion Skills or Reversal Actions in reaction to Burning Gold's superflash assuming they have sufficient invuln and have not special-canceled into something.\nBeing wary of when Yang enters Semblance is very important since it provides a brief pause to examine the opponent as soon as she is grounded and in neutral. If the opponent commits to either a high startup or high recovery option, the pause Semblance offers provides enough time to safely \"punish\" with Burning Gold or Reversal Action, since both are frame 1 invuln and quickly active. While the timing is relatively strict since poor timing will have Yang stuffed by an opponent's active frames, getting it down and recognizing when the opponent has committed too hard is important for punishing opponents that do not respect Semblance's activation.\nFor all Burning Gold's strengths, it is not entirely better than Unrelenting Fire (214B+C). First, its invuln can lose to Distortion Skills and Reversal Actions with higher invuln. Second, it does leave Yang point-blank to the opponent when blocked, so if Yang's partner is available, be prepared to Distortion Skill Duo or Cross Burst (and avoid predictable timing) if using it riskily."

Even more wary opponents can cancel into their own Distortion Skills or Reversal Actions in reaction to Burning Gold's superflash assuming they have sufficient invuln and have not special-canceled into something.\nBeing wary of when Yang enters Semblance is very important since it provides a brief pause to examine the opponent as soon as she is grounded and in neutral. If the opponent commits to either a high startup or high recovery option, the pause Semblance offers provides enough time to safely \"punish\" with Burning Gold or Reversal Action, since both are frame 1 invuln and quickly active. While the timing is relatively strict since poor timing will have Yang stuffed by an opponent's active frames, getting it down and recognizing when the opponent has committed too hard is important for punishing opponents that do not respect Semblance's activation.\nFor all Burning Gold's strengths, it is not entirely better than Unrelenting Fire (214B+C). First, its invuln can lose to Distortion Skills and Reversal Actions with higher invuln. Second, it does leave Yang point-blank to the opponent when blocked, so if Yang's partner is available, be prepared to Distortion Skill Duo or Cross Burst (and avoid predictable timing) if using it riskily.",

This means this loses to physical attacks with long hitboxes; say goodbye to parrying every hit of Merkava's supers. You'll really get the most out of it when countering a projectile, but since those aren't done up close, what you can do  to punish them is limited. At the very least, cancelling into 236B+C is a good, long range punish, and 214BC can lead into a combo if close enough, or be a high damage punish to a partner."

Decently fast for being a full screen projectile. It will not hit small opponents that are close to Blitztank.\nThe least applicable assist of Blitztank. While having a full screen laser is indeed useful, a feature that is relatively rare for assists, it covers a downward angle from Blitztank and it's speed makes it harder to use than many other projectile assists like Hyde 6P. The lack of lockdown too makes it fairly weak for anything more than screen coverage to facilitate the point character's zoning or to let them run in. It being a laser does make it strong at hitting the opponents assist however.",

However, for how good it is, it also comes with some issues. It has no invulnerability, with the exception being the first frame during the super flash. It's unsafe on block, but depending on the distance to the opponent that might be hard for them to take advantage of. But anyone with their own full screen option will be able to readily punish it. On top of that, it actually has less minimum damage than Blitzlauf, however in situations where that matters only really come up in very long and highly prorated combos.  \nDue to lasting a fairly long time, some fast DSD follow-ups allow for further combos afterwards, letting certain teams get high damage from long range snipes and confirms.What else did you expect really?",
