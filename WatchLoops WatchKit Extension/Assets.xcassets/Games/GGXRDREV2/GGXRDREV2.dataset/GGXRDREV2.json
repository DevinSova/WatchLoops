Overall only worth it in a pinch to keep people honest. However, as mentioned before, the scroll version has some more uses, particularly against zoning. It also gives a few characters a really hard time at applying their ideal oki, but is still high risk against knowledgeable players.\n\nCan be YRC'ed during the counterattack. Can also be super jump installed by inputting it as 228P, which allows you to airdash after having YRC'ed it.\n",

It's a very strong option simply for movement, as Answer's dash is not good, to be used at a range where the palm strike won't connect. This is one of its main use outside of combos.\n\nRisky to pressure after in blockstrings, and essentially invalid against the majority of characters, as you are -1 on normal block (-4 and thus punishable on IB), and at close range with no real RPS involved. In blockstrings, only use it as a last-resort frametrap in cases where you want higher potential reward than non-YRC card frametrap (remember, you can link 5P on counterhit). If Resshou is blocked, you should probably just backdash and take it from there.\n\nOn a 5H hit confirm, it can be decent to use to re-establish close range pressure against characters that don't have great close range options, esp. on crouch confirm (crouching adds 1F of hitstun to all attacks), or to RRC into a full combo. Keep in mind that at +/-0 frames, many characters have strong options for counterplay, and most can guess correctly to beat any of your follow-ups, so use it with care and be attentive of your opponent's habits. \n",

Benefits considerably from high RISC. The Burst version is passable as a reversal. \n\nAirborne: Answer does not throw a card up and has a much shorter starting animation. The barrage is also directed diagonally downward at about a 45-degree angle. Unfortunately, not very useful; it does low damage for 50%, and gives an absolutely pitiful knockdown, while having no other truly unique properties (Might be worth it if you've already got low scrolls set and are in the corner, yet don't have a high scroll to convert your antiair or air to air into. But jD > RRC > P scroll set > sD > sH basically does this better). It does however benefit from high RISC. After using it, dash back in with Resshou.\n\nIn theory it could be used as an air-to-ground punish if the opponent's HP is very low. Would be more practical if it had a simpler input.\n",

When used in this capacity, it is strike invulnerable for over half its duration, but can be thrown at any point in its duration. Azami Mawarikomi cannot be YRCed, but if used correctly gives Baiken enough time to sidestep and throw opponents. Also good for getting around projectiles like Venom's balls and getting out of the corner, as it allows Baiken to effectively negate the hitstop-based advantage projectiles offer.. Generally weak to YRC and is best used intermittently now that it is not her only invulnerable guard cancel option. Use to dodge big normals with bad recovery.\n\nAzami Mawarikomi interacts interestingly with Azami's hitstop properties, in that if activated immediately on a strike the invulnerability frames of Mawarikomi will effectively be wasted in hitstop, when Baiken was not in danger of being hit anyway. This means a fast Mawarikomi should be used with the aggressive intention to step in and throw, and delayed Mawarikomi with the intention of making a big recovery normal whiff.\n\nSuzuran Mawarikomi has no invulnerability but will sometimes evade slow normals. Primarily used to switch sides on okizeme, especially after Rokkonsogi knockdowns, but this sacrifices okizeme quality. Since it is possible to superjump over opponents after rokkonsogi and get a safejump mixup, Suzuran mawarikomi in this capacity is only good for when you have meter to spare for tatami yrc on okizeme, or when the spacing is too awkward for a superjump mixup.\n",

Sakura's downsides are that it is relatively slow, and will only give guaranteed counterhits on moves with exaggerated hitstop (e.g Sol's Fafnir, Blitz Attacks); otherwise you will have to rely on your opponent continuing to press buttons to score your big counterhits.\n\nSuzuran Sakura has no invulnerability and the same slow startup as Azami Sakura, making its usefulness limited to being a hard callout against opponents mashing in blockstrings. A good option to go for opponents who only react to suzuran with backthrow mash. It is negative on block and quite punishable on instant block. Use sparingly.\n",

It is used in blockstrings, to convert into knockdowns from range, and to chase down opponents. Suzuran Rokkonsogi also launches on counter hit for huge damage, and it trades abusively which makes it a pretty good move for flailing with.

It takes forever to start up, and there is at least a 21 frame gap on block between Kabari and the grab, so you put yourself at a lot of risk just by trying it. In exchange, you get just around 30 more damage and a bit more meter gain than a regular corner throw combo. Try it if you think your opponent is downbacking and afraid, or if they really have no idea how to mash out of stagger and you just want to make them feel bad. \nWill occasionally grab people trying to blitz through Kabari > Tetsuzansen, but you really shouldn't rely on anything about this move.\n",

On hit, Tetsuzansen builds a good amount of meter, making it good in combos when you can use it. If it clips opponents jumping away late after a blocked Kabari, Tetsuzansen can lead into big combos that build a lot of meter.\n\nMuch of the old utility of Tetsuzansen as an emergency move is gone due to its almost doubled startup, but it still has some invulnerability and is throw invulnerable until active frames start, meaning it can be used to call out people mashing throws after being pulled into close range by Kabari, or throwing high recovery normals to try to punish a whiffed Kabari.\n",

The gap between Kabari>Rokkonsogi can get very small even on IB, so you can use it to beat people trying to IB Kabari and mash.\n\nIt is possible to simply link a Suzuran Rokkonsogi after Kabari instead to mask the frame disadvantage and fish for Azami counterhits, since the two have almost indistinguishable animations.\n",

With 50 meter, Youzansen leads into huge damage when used in the corner and good damage and corner carry when used midscreen. Can be used as an unorthodox mobility toll because of the way it alters Baiken's aerial momentum or as a tech option because of its huge hitbox. All around an incredible move. You aren't playing Baiken until you start abusing it.\n\nIt's also an enormous move that comes out in 6f, covers all areas around her over the next 12 frames, shrinks her hurtbox during startup and trades abusively because of its very extended CH hitstun. Punishable on air IB but generally not on normal block in air-to-air confrontations. Good for catching characters that like to stall high in the air (e.g. Ramlethal).\n",

The Wall Alpha we know may be gone, but it will forever live in our hearts.\n\nI first met Wall Alpha when I picked up Guilty Gear Xrd Sign from the Steam store in 2016. Our first encounter was awesome. I remember going into the challenges section and looking at how cool alpha into alpha looked. I grinded and struggled at first to do alpha wall cling cancel wall alpha at first, but it filled me with joy to see Wall Alpha be so key in Chipp's corner oki and that it\u2019s used on all of his corner combos. Wall Alpha was always there to get me a knockdown in the corner and add a bunch of damage to my corner bnb\u2019s while retaining corner. Every Chipp player appreciated Wall Alpha and before every game they would dream of landing one for that corner knockdown.\nWall Alpha\u2019s best friends, HS teleport and Ryuu Yanagi, are here with us as well to pay respects to Wall Alpha. HS teleport would tell me stories of how the two would team up to blend everyone into smoothies in the corner. Ryuu Yanagi would love to do the honors of providing one of the most difficult to block mixups in the game. Wall Alpha is loved by many friends and family, and I feel that we are all equally blessed to be part of his life, as he was part of ours.\n\nI will remember Wall Alpha. You all will remember Wall Alpha. People will still talk about this special move who\u2019s oki carried so many Chipp players to adulthood. Although Wall Alpha is gone now, we will live on with a lesson. Enjoy your specials in their wonderful lifespan before they get nerfed. Never take any special for granted.\n\nThank you Wall Alpha. My dear friend. My best friend. Thank you and good bye.\n",

It has longer range than her standard pokes, but with that comes longer startup and recovery and as such it's much more situational and dangerous to throw out.

Because it's also special cancellable, 6H knockdowns give Dizzy some of the best opportunities to setup okizeme, even better than 2D.  6H is the only move Dizzy has that leaves opponents faceup on knockdown, which can be really advantageous in some matchups.\n",

It loses to some moves that go airborne, some 6Ps and some low profiles. Used on block or hit to go for tick throws.  Very effective button in some situations in neutral or to catch dash resets and hard to punish if whiffed.\n\nIt is also an essential normal for pressure, as from 2P you have the most options for pressure and resets, such as going into 2K, doing throw resets, or doing frame traps or staggered pressure.  In general the further into your gatlings you go the less options your opponent has to think about, and 2P is your earliest point of entry so expect to use this a lot to start or reset pressure.\n\nFrame traps include 2P > 5H, 2P > f.S, 2P > 6P, and 2P > 2D.  \n",

This move is essential to her gameplan as it covers her projectiles vs low profiles, as well as catches people mashing throws, reversals and jumps to try to beat her tick throw attempts.  She also needs this move to check moves that are only low vulnerable.  Used on block or hit to go for tick throws or confirm into 2D.   2K is also very useful for frame traps. 2K > 2H is a very rewarding frame trap with a 4f gap, other examples are 2K > 6P, 2K > f.S and 2K > 2D.

The ability to properly space yourself and stop aerial approaches with 2S is essential, as unlike most characters Dizzy prefers to anti-air by going directly underneath the enemy instead of stopping them at a 45 degree angle.  The hit box doesn't center on her body like in XX games, and is less thick and less tall.  This leaves it unreliable to AA with if the opponent is behind her.  2S is also one of her few buttons that can come out on top in trades due to its massive counter hit properties.  Can be used as a burst safe move as well, especially after 5D6.\n",

It does good damage and leads to damaging follow-ups, it shines as a strong frametrap or a punish tool for big mistakes like whiffed reversals.

Like 421S the hitbox is also rather thin and the auto-lock is easily foiled by movement such as jumps or dashes towards Dizzy.  At further ranges it can also just miss crouching opponents who don't move.  It is also less reliable in the corner as the spears can go offscreen in some situations before connecting.\n\nA risky move in neutral due to its over half a second startup and unreliable tracking.  It can however be YRC'd to let Dizzy freely move while up to 3 spears are held, but blocking or being hit while spears are held makes them dissapear.  With specific timing of YRC, one spear can be shot while one or two are held.  421H are high damage so learning to utilize them in the proper situations is important, such as after 236S RRC in combos or after knockdown for high damage okizeme.  Spears only meaty off high knockdowns but a meaty normal can be used after summoning.  Some 421H okizeme setups are non meaty so require the opponent to respect them, however the high damage threat and conditioning of her true meaty setups allow other options to work.\n",

Clips jumping people. Mostly useful during zoning projectile battles. TK to make the best use of it.\n\n214H\nH fish is similar to S fish except it remains at ground level. This is one of your primary space-control summons and is also useful for okizeme despite not hitting meaty after most grounded combos into knockdown from 2D.  Can be super jumped out of on wakeup by some characters with fast wakeup timing.  Often paired with j.S or 2K meaty in those situations.\n\nj.214H\nAerial H fish is H fish but with faster startup and longer recovery than the ground version and provides amazing air to ground control. Mostly useful during zoning projectile battles. TK to make the best use of it.\n\n214D\nD fish is unique in that it has no hitbox by default, but must be triggered by getting hit by an opponent's hitbox. Once it's hit, it charges forward with a homing chomp that tracks extremely well. Useful to bait opponents mashing and to make neutral awkward for the opponent.  Causes a forced knockdown on air CH, staggers on ground hit. Used both against rushdown and zoning.  Just be aware it doesn't protect Dizzy entire body.  Still a very useful move and essential in many matchups.\n",

Usually bubbles are tiger knee'd 2369P to allow bubbles to come out close to the ground and allow low to the ground air actions, such as airdash or falling j.H/j.S.\n\nVersatile uses include:\n\nThe main downside to bubble, though it can be considered a large one, is the long recovery.  Using Bubble at unsafe times can become a habit because having them out is so beneficial and they are not always read and punished but it exposes a lot of risk to your gameplay.  You can YRC bubble pretty early to make it safer however.\n",

In the corner Imperial Ray becomes even more niche, as only a few pillars will be active before it goes off the screen.

The mirror itself can actually reflects most non-beam projectiles, blows the opponent back on hit, safe on block. It has an extremely high hitbox but rather small horizontal hitbox, and is kinda simple to whiff punish. Decent reversal, and can prove an amazing reversal in some situations, for instance it reflects I-No\u2019s note,Sol's gunflame, and Ky's stun edge so if they meaty you with it, their own projectiles becomes yours. On CH it has the highest stun modifier out of Dizzy\u2019s entire moveset and in the corner, wallsplats the opponent and leads to a 100% stun combo (does 1638 stun value and 3363 on CH).\n\nThis attack will generally reflect most things that are \"standard\" projectiles: they travel in a straight line and don't do anything weird when they hit something.  Projectiles with different trajectories (Raven's orb), instant travel time (Dizzy's own lasers), unusual hit properties (Chipp's Gamma Blade), or other caveats will NOT be reflected.  Some moves that are or aren't projectiles (Eddie) are not considered projectiles by the mirror.  The mirror will never reflect supers, although sometimes the invulnerability will let Dizzy punish the attacker.\n\nFor a full list of what Dizzy reflects, check this link: http://pastebin.com/Vw4gdaKi\n\nMirror being so slow makes it very baitable by enemies expecting it, many meaty attacks can recover before mirror is active, which allows your opponent to do some nasty option selects vs mirror, being able to meaty in complete safety.  For example most characters can input a meaty low > close slash > block and then continue their pressure/combo if you didn't mirror and be safe if you did, in some cases mirror even whiffs making it not safe for Dizzy at all.\n\nThat said it can be a very valuable tool so don't count it out.\n\nAnother possible technique is Mirror YRC.  If you YRC before mirror is active, you only use 25% meter overall.  However you still get the startup invulnerability, meaning you could invulnerable through anything up to 14 frames, though getting all frames requires very good timing.  This is situationally useful to invuln out of things for only 25% meter.\n",

(This also goes for crouching normals with hurtboxes that extend upwards, meaning it will lose to almost any 2H.) 5th hit blows away and knocks down on ground hit, blows away and doesn't knock down on air hit. Longest reaching normal.\nA great normal that reaches half-screen and stuff a LOT of things in neutral. Extremely fast for the range it covers and the 5 hits alone do 76 damage(Sol). With an RC, you can corner carry, get big damage and still have your knockdown which is quite easy considering the 5 hits for hitconfirming it.\nIn several matchups, getting around it can be a pain for the opponent so make sure to watch your spacing and throw it out sometimes to annoy them. It can easily be low profiled by some moves and on block, the opponent can crouch block to make it completely whiff.\nHowever, the YRC window frame is particularly lenient and seems to go up to the end of the active frames. Add the fact that it's self cancelable and with 25% tension, you got a huge window to YRC it for safety and to potentially punish the opponent if he tried to low profile it.\n\nKeep in mind however that despite triggering pineberry and looking like a projectile, it is considered to be a normal attack and will thus lose against any projectile. Also, it extends her hurtbox by quite a bit. Roughly half of the hitbox is actually her hurtbox. The vertical hitbox isn't as big as it looks like, so it will only beat IAD but any other kind of air approach will make it whiff.\nOverall, a very strong neutral tool that becomes a nightmare for your opponent if you have 25% tension or more.\nIt's possible to use an OS with it thanks to the lenient YRC window which is 5H>214K~YRC. If 5H whiffs, you will get a YRC. If it gets blocked or it hits, you will do 214K instead. Unless you're quite close, 5H>214K on block is + and 5H CH>214K combo even at max range allowing to get a knockdown.\n",

You can also YRC to make it easier to aim by slowing the opponent down. \nMain problem however is that the level 1 shot gives relatively poor reward and entering and/or leaving the stance has a significant recovery making it a low reward/high risk option in some matchups.\nLevel 1 shot is pretty much something you will use once in a while against characters like Venom or Ky to make them stop zoning, but it can also be key in matchups against bigger slower characters.\n\nLevel 2 shot is completely unblockable and is used in specific okizeme situations with the pineberry. Please check the okizeme section at the bottom of the page for more details.\nUnlike level 1 shot, level 2 shot actually has 70% initial proration.\n",

They are also considered to be projectiles, and will cancel any projectile that hits once (except overdrives).\n46H has to be done right afterwards if you want to keep shotgun stance.\n\nNormal SG-H\n3f normal. Extremely fast for its range. When done close, will give you a hard knockdown, but air hits near the edges of the hitbox will allow the opponent to tech out.\nGenerally a combo filler that is used either at the end of SG-P strings for a knockdown or looped on air hit for more damage. Useful for combos involving grenade detonation in okizeme or neutral situations.\n\nYou can loop {SG-H>46H}xN during corner pressure if you want to, but each shot is -5 on instant block, giving the opponent an opportunity to escape or challenge the attack. However, the hitbox is so big that mashing out of it becomes a big risk. Past a certain distance however you won't get a knockdown and will need a RC to combo afterwards. The main reason why you would still keep looping it however is because of the chip damage, the ridiculous tension gain it gives and the fact that the pushback isn't affected by faultless defense. If the opponent intends to block and wait for you to end up too far to loop it, you can do SG-S and reset pressure for more loops.\n\nPowered SG-H\nOnly one word is necessary to describe this move: Ridiculous.\nRidiculous speed, damage, hitstun and hitbox.\nOnce Elphelt has the charge, SG-H comes out in ONE FRAME after you press the button.\nMidscreen, you won't really get much out of it aside from a knockdown. Also blows the opponent away and causes them to tumble when they land if it lands as a counter hit in the deeper part of the hitbox.\nIn the corner however, if done close enough, you will get a 35f wallsplat on normal hit and a 71f long one on CH allowing Elphelt to loop powered SG-H into itself for huge damage. Landing a charged shot on the edges of the hitbox is also used in some \"sourspot\" unblockable setups.\n\nPowered SG-H can be particularly strong during pressure too and an easy and low risk way to finish off an opponent with low health.\nIt deals 8% chip damage alone (ignores guts rating) and removes 20% tension if the opponent FD it while being +5 on normal block.\n",

Any other situations will generally require a hard read which makes it really useful only in certain matchups.\n\nDuring pressure, Elphelt can cross-up the opponent with it and make quite a lot of reversals whiff thanks to its invul frames. It will however lose quite badly against 2P mashing so you will have to make sure that your opponent respects your pressure before using it.\n\nOverall, a rather matchup dependent tool with situational crossup mixup applications when grenade is out.\n",

Lots of untechable frames on air hit. Excellent move for confirming grenade explosions into air combos or shotgun loops as well as situational anti-air purposes.\nYou can however be thrown or hit out of it quite easily during pressure, and it is -3 on instant block. Don't rely on it too much.\n\nDuring pressure, the fact that it's slow makes it great against opponents who think that they can fuzzy jump SG-D. Use SG-S to prove how wrong they are.\n\nHumorously, if the opponent isn't mashing out of stagger, SG-S will grey combo into itself indefinitely on the ground.\n",

It should also be noted that the loops following SG-D generally allow you to get up to 90% tension.\nA frightening mixup tool when you consider how strong her stagger pressure and okizeme is.\n\nFrame advantage listed is when throw is successful.

However, once learned your mixup options improve dramatically.  Should also be used from time to time in block strings to avoid being too predictable, and you'll need to combo into it in some situations (such as a j.D FDC mixup out of block pressure) since I-No may push herself out too far to link into 6P against skinny characters like Venom, Zato, I-No, Millia.

Now you get stagger on CH, but they can mash out of the stagger in the same amount of time that the CH used to give, so it's a worthless buff against people that know the matchup and can mash out of stagger.  The problem with this move is that at maximum range you can't combo into HCL unless you CH, and on CH you can't really get much more than that (knockdown) unless you spend meter.  If they mash out of stagger they can recover quicker than you can dash in for a better punish, so the stagger is worth nearly nothing.  They also gave it 2 more active frames, but we're not sure if they replaced recovery frames or were just added in.  In most cases where you'd want to poke with this, 2S is a better option because it recovers slightly faster, has more range, and will actually combo into HCL on regular hit more consistently.\n",

Patch 1.1 increased the forward slide effect, so now you can link HCL from further away on most characters... unless they're crouching.  Lots of recovery so take care when using it, but it's still less recovery than f.S.  Unfortunately, hitting a crouching opponent near max range doesn't lead to any real reward without spending meter.  You can cancel into Note or STBT, but you'll leave a gap that they can hang you for.  They'll crouch under HCL, and 2D's nerfed range means you can't even knock down.  5H and 2H also have reduced range, and while you can combo into 5H at close range and link IAD j.K on tall characters, it's not as efficient as I-No's usual BnBs.  5D has enough range since it's actually bigger than 2S, but it's even slower than Note or STBT, and there's no real opportunity to mix up out of 2S since 2D (low) wont reach. Mashing could beat both STBT-S (low) and 5D (overhead) anyway.  Anyone that knows the matchup wont be caught blocking low against 5D in this circumstance - if you use it here, you're trying to catch them going for a punish since you out-range many pokes.\n\n2S is still a useful move if you have 50% to RC with.  Now you have a move that can punish a whiff from almost 1/2 screen into a full combo with corner push, or big damage in the corner.\n",

Otherwise, throw it in from time to time in the corner when you're at a distance.  Worthless on air hit, so be cautious given the risk of using it.  Very active, so you could meaty it on oki for shenanigans and use the unexpected frame advantage to score a counter hit. On YRC is a mid attack. A universal 5D gimmick is to YRC late into startup and hit low or throw.  Some buffs to other moves in 1.1 improved the damage you can get from this in the corner. \n",

If you knock the other player down with HCL~D, you may not have enough time to force them to block with note.

On CH with perfect spacing you can potentially combo into c.S for a more substantial combo.  Usually though, you'll just get knockdown (or they'll tech).  If they react too slow to AA you and block, you're safe if you spaced it just right.  Great it certain matchups for dealing with certain tools, like SlideHead.\n",

It also leaves you in a counterhit state on recovery, making it very dangerous if the opponent crouches it. Range seems worse than AC/+R, but with the simpler motion it's understandable.  The hitbox takes longer to come out starting around max f.S range which can cause some combos to drop (you'll lose the knockdown from HCL).  More untech time, so it's useable in some combos in the corner.  Also pretty good when YRCd during neutral.  The derivative follow up can be used with both the ground and air versions of this move, but only on hit or block.  Knocking down with derivative gives less advantage time for oki than dive knockdown, so take care to use it when you have at least 25% so you can dash in and VCL YRC or use Note YRC for oki, or when it'll kill, or when there's no alternative that gives knockdown. Airborne on frame 1. I-No's hurtbox also no longer allows her to dodge lows.\n",

However, throwing this super on reaction would be much harder when used as a reversal because of the restriction on throws when waking up.  Safe on block. It can be used as a combo-finisher but Fortissimo is a better option for that. Goes through projectiles and untechable knockdown. 80% prorate means that it can be used as a combo starter, but ultimately Fortissimo is a better combo starter due to no proration if you get an opportunity to punish.  If you have 50% meter when you run your corner oki, it's actually worthwhile to use 2D in place of 2K sometimes (since 2D doesn't prorate) and confirm into Desperation for full damage, then follow up with a full combo.\n",

However, this move is still frame 0 after the flash, which means this move basically wins in any situation where the other player isn't invul at the time of the super flash.  It's + on block (no longer sure by how much) so you get to run a mixup if they manage to block, and on hit it sets up a high-damage combo.  Because the invul only lasts up to the active frame, Fortissimo will trade with or lose to most 6P attacks (the upper body invul) and will lose to other Reversals depending on timing and how much invul they have.  It's pretty much guaranteed to lose to an uppercut, though it may beat other supers if it goes second.  Don't forget that supers gain hellfire damage in Xrd, and beat Blitz Shield.\n",

If they're too close to you and their next attack is timed just right, it could mess up trying to throw them away and instead force the opponent to air tech near you. \n\nThis is the usual air combo ender for Jack-O combos. When determining which direction to have the opponent spit out, be sure to verify the current situation. For instance, if your close to the corner, you'll probably want to toss them into the corner and proceed to try and have your servants lockdown the opponent. Other times if the right servants are nearby, it might be best to have the opponent spit out towards them to try and extend your combo. \n\nIt does need to be emphasized that, despite the move behaving in most regards like a throw, the initial hit behaves like a normal mid attack, meaning it can be blocked and punished from all positions.\n\nIt can also be used a somewhat cheeky opener, depending on the matchup and what the opponent chooses to lead with. If it does strike, it puts you in an excellent position as you absolutely have time to set down at least one Ghost and get Aegis Field up if the matchup calls for it. It is a risky opening, however, as a number of opposing openings will beat it in frames handily.\n\nDo note that like all of Jack-O's D moves, it'll use meter if meter is available.

Since it moves him forward slightly, is an excellent way to continue pressuring, and is great on mist cancel. Because Johnny is airborne during 2H, this move is Air Mist Cancelable. Though you can gatling into 2H from almost any of his ground normals, none of them besides f.S can combo into 2H unless they are counterhit. Luckily, this also means 2H can be used as a natural frame trap, especially from lower attack level normals or when delay chained. At all mist levels, 2H is comboable into Mist Finer Mid and Low. At LV1, it's comboable into j.P, but you cannot airdash. At LV2/3, it's now comboable into j.K or j.D, and you can airdash afterwards for more pressure. Be aware that even at LV3, 6Ps and fast normals can stuff the airdash approach. This move is also extremely important for combo'ing, as it is one of the best ways for Johnny to transition into an Air Mist Finer by using the f.S > 2H route. \n",

Landing a coin powers up Johnny's Mist Finer, drastically increasing his combo potential and offensive power. Because of this, when at Mist Finer Level 1, landing a Coin or combo'ing into a Coin is extremely crucial. Coin is an extremely powerful tool outside of combos, and often allows Johnny an easy way out of many difficult situations. However, because Coins are limited, knowing how to plan ahead and pace your coin usage properly is key to mastering Johnny. Having no coins left severely limits Johnny's combo potential - even with a significant life lead, being stuck with no coins puts Johnny in a severely disadvantageous position. On the other hand, one should avoid being overly conservative with Coins - losing a round with tons of coins left is generally considered a waste. Johnny's Treasure Hunt super replenishes two coins on hit - use Treasure Hunt proactively when you feel you need more coins to finish the round. \n",

The hitbox for the second hit of Zweihander occurs around Johnny's midsection and downward. Connecting the Zweihander when the opponent is slightly above Johnny is a good guideline (but not too high, or Zweihander 1st hit will whiff).

The only drawback is that if you do not input cleanly, coins(236H) will appear and you will probably lose the round instead.\n\nYou can combo into IK without Roman Cancel after Lv2 ground Mid Mist Finer hits, or Lv3 Mid Mist Finer.\nBy using Roman cancels, IK can be comboed into any Lv2 or Lv3 Mist Finer. \n\nThe Killer Joker\n\nSame as 5H. But no hurtbox or throwbox.\n",

Still, this projectile has lengthy startup, and the initial projectile hitbox is a bit in front of Haehyun, meaning an opponent can often jump over the fireball and cleanly hit Haehyun during startup. Additionally, it is incredibly unsafe in blockstrings and the like, meaning that close range use of S Tuning Ball needs to be supplemented with YRC.\n\n236H\n\nThe linchpin of Haehyun's okizeme, H Tuning Ball allows her to force her opponent to block the projectile for one hit, and then have the fireball float behind the opponent with two additional hits to supplement Haehyun's pressure. Safe pressure, combos from normal throw, and multiple 50/50 high low mixups can be inflicted upon the opponent from a single knockdown with proper conditioning and control of 236H. \n",

By late canceling other attacks into c.S in pressure, you can create a frame trap to catch opponents pressing buttons. On Counter Hit, it will combo into 6H, leading to high damage combos. It's fast startup and high damage makes it a good punish tool, too. It hits a bit higher up than implied by the animation, and works as an anti-air occasionally. By pressing 6H+S to execute a throw, you'll get this attack if the opponent jumped or backdashed. This is much faster than 5H or 6H, and if an opponent successfully jumps your throw attempt but didn't hold Faultless Defense, they may be caught.\n",

Ky's hurtbox is extended very far forward during the swing, so opponents can punish this if used recklessly. If your confirms and sense of spacing are strong, you can cancel into Stun Dipper on hit for a knockdown. Some characters can get under this attack with low profile moves, mix it up with 5H, 2S, and Stun Edge if they start to find ways around f.S.

This move is a key part of ending pressure because of it's long cancel window and advantage on block. You can choose to end with 5H, or late cancel into 2D to trip opponents expecting to escape.

It hits twice, which is great for dealing with moves with armor like Potemkin's Hammerfall, it launches on Counter Hit which opens up high damage potential, and it is also jump cancelable both on hit and block which makes it hilariously safe as long as you actually hit the opponent. The startup can sometimes be a bit too slow to anti-air on reaction with, but overall it's very fast for how large it is. The recovery isn't insignificant, but it's relatively safe for what it is.\n",

It's possible to cross up an opponent's block by airdashing over them the moment they wake up into j.D. It also functions as an anti-zoning tool, since j.D also creates a Grinder, allowing you to immediately use Air Stun Edge afterwards for a DC Stun Edge. It has a ton of untech time on Counter Hit, so if you're in range run up and pick a combo up. If done close enough to the ground, ground Stun Edges can pass through the air grinder set by J.D.\n",

                        "Description": "Vapor Thrust (VT) is Ky's invulnerable reversal attack. The S version (SVT) is extremely rewarding on Counter Hit and starts up/recovers slightly faster than the HS version, but it has much less invulnerability time. It's usually used as a high risk high reward anti-air, or in specific situations on defense to take advantage of the long untechable time on Counter Hit to pick up a combo.\n\nWhile better than SVT, as far as wakeup reversals go, HVT is risky; it loses to some low profile attacks and easily loses to safe jumps, so you need to be sure the opponent isn't doing one of those before attempting this. It also starts up slowly in comparison to other reversals, and has a lack of forward momentum and range. Despite this, HVT is a good tool for dealing with pressure since it still has a good amount of invul. It also hits on both sides of Ky, making it one of the rare reversals that can be useful for dealing with crossups (as long as your input isn't crossed up). Ky is not left in Counter Hit or crouching state during the recovery either, so it loses a bit associated risk when the opponent has no tension to punish hard. As long as the opponent doesn't low profile it, you can use HVT RC to escape oki and pick up a combo if it hit, though you might want to save the tension for FD or Dead Angle if you don't want to play risky. Outside of defense, it can be used to anti air some moves that otherwise counter Ky's 6P and 2H, though its startup leaves a bit to be desired and if they see it coming in time they may be able to YRC and punish you for your trouble. It's integral in Ky's combos, including Vapor Thrust loops, Split Ciel loops, and Dash VT combos. On medium and heavy weight characters it will score knockdowns pretty easily, but light characters tend to float too high and can recover before hitting the ground.\n\nj.623S/H\n\nBecause air VT lacks a low hitting hitbox (much like the grounded version), it's rare to see it used in the air like Sol would use his Volcanic Viper. 99% of the time you use this move it will be to end air combos. It can be a wild card option in a pinch though.\n",

Its upper body invulnerability, ridiculously fast startup, and long travel distance make it useful in a wide variety of situations. SD can be used to counter an opponent by sliding under their attacks that don't cover the ground, and to confirm knockdowns from combos and pokes spaced at the tip of f.S, 2S, and 5H. It's also commonly used to counter pressure during even small gaps left by the opponent. Though it is an invaluable tool it's also very punishable on block. This is made worse because it's also really finicky to get both the slide and the followup slash to combo unless you were spaced correctly or got a Counter Hit. Because of this it's risky to throw out unless you read the opponent correctly or can confirm your spacing quickly. Ky's neutral game becomes many times better once he has 50 tension because he can mitigate all the negative consequences of SD and threaten his opponent constantly with it. If it hits, you can save the meter or go RC it for damage. If it's blocked or dodged, RC or PRC will keep you safe and put you in an advantageous position.\n",

While faster than most dusts, it has a unique animation and loud audio cue that makes it easier to react to.  Though it's somewhat lacking as a pure mixup tool, GS begins to shine when used to catch defensive mashing, backdashes, low attacks in neutral, and active and aggressive neutral play. Using Greed Sever when pushed away from an opponent is strong since it will catch air dashing, jumping, and some attacks. If it connects with an opponents block at the tip near the end of the animation it's safe on block. It's typically reserved until 50 Tension is saved up to RC it just in case it's blocked. Leaves Ky in a crouching state on recovery.\n",

On hit it will stagger the opponent which can create some gimmicky mixup and pressure reset opportunities if they're not good at mashing out of the stagger. SC is also Ky's signature VT loop combo ender, it's the reason he can setup DC CSE oki and go for free IAD/empty jump mixups. Ending blockstrings with SC is an option, because it's only -1 on block and leaves Ky with a Grinder to work with. Beware using it to end pressure when too far from the opponent, since it has a decent amount of whiff recovery and can be punished if they're looking for it. Also you can annoy Venoms that like to 2S at round start with it.\n",

Its horizontal movement allows it to beat options that would otherwise counter Vapor Thrust but in the end it's still the same speed as HVT. It is unsafe on block and has Counter Hit recovery, so it's risky. That said, it can be strangely difficult to punish due to the way each hit of RTL pushes the opponent away. This can be mitigated by IBing the last hit, but depending on Ky's position the timing changes, so it can be difficult. Ending your common midscreen air combos with RTL is a good way to add damage and score knockdowns where you usually can't.\n",

You can hold the button and make use of the threat of being able to send the dolphin to attack at any time to discourage the opponent from doing anything, making it easy to approach them.\n\nIn pressure, the fact that you can hold the button to determine when the dolphin attacks gives you a lot of options for oki. You can release the button right away to send the Dolphin ahead of you before you start your pressure. This has 2 good benefits. The first benefit is that sending the dolphin ahead of you forces the opponent into blockstun and locks out their ability to do a reversal on wakeup when you start your pressure. The second benefit is that if you are already close enough to go for a mixup right away, the dolphin colliding with the blocking opponent can partially visually obscure your mixup. You can also release the button at a key point in your blockstring and take advantage of the time that the dolphin attacks to reset pressure.\n\nIn combos, if you already have the dolphin out and waiting, it can be a good way to extend a combo in places where you'd usually have to RC to get a longer combo. For example, you can do stuff like 2D > (Release Dolphin) > Continue with air combo\n\nP version summons the hoop at ground level in front of May, making it great for oki. It's also useful for extending pressure \n\nK version summons the hoop up in the air in front of May, making the trajectory that the Dolphin will take great for making a wall to prevent your opponent's approach. If they're close enough, it can be useful for preventing in oki to prevent them from both jumping out.\n\nS version summons the hoop at ground level about half a screen away from May. Great in neutral to make opponents with ranged options afraid to use them and against opponents standing full screen away in general.\n\nHS version summons the hoop up in the air about half a screen away from May. Great in neutral for creating a wall that's hard to pass for opponent's standing far away. \n",

May can also kill her forward momentum by using an air normal within a certain frame window when the dolphin hits or is blocked, enabling her deadly dolphin cancel mixup.

However, the second hit has had its hitbox lowered, which makes it more stable in most situations. You now want the opponent about level with May for a successful corner knockdown. Additionally, hitting Ensenga roughly a third of a screen away from the corner will carry the opponent into the corner. Ensenga YRC moves May forward and upward, which can be desirable in some situations e.g. dodging Ramlethal's Calvados.\n",

But in general you're better off only using this on grounded combos for the knockdown, and sticking with Hammerfall cancels for pressure.\n",

The first is Potemkin's actual body, a standard attack that hits low and knocks the opponent down if they don't block it. Once he lands, the shockwave occurs: if the opponent is on the ground when it happens, they get knocked down. In both cases, the opponent is knocked down for considerably longer than usual, giving Potemkin plenty of time to close the distance, if applicable, and set up okizeme. Note, however, that if the first attack connects, even if it's blocked, the shockwave will not occur.\n\nSlide Head has some upper body invincibility as it starts up, which might be enough to get you out of a counter-poke, but don't rely on it too heavily.\n\nThere is also a window in which Potemkin can hit the ground and create the shockwave effects, but then YRC before the actual shockwave occurs. Great if you're trying to scare the opponent into jumping. \n\nYou can also time Slide Head so that the shockwave hits just as the opponent is getting up. Only a reversal backdash, blitz, or another move with frame-one invuln/airborne state, will save an opponent from this. You can then RC, slowing down time and extending their knockdown animation, giving you time to combo them while they're still airborne and do some big damage.\n\nThere are some exceptions to the rules for Slide Head's shockwave. Some characters have dashes that are considered airborne, which allow them to avoid the shockwave simply by dashing forward (I-no, Ramlethal, Dizzy, Johnny, etc). Generally these dashes have obvious effects, like teleportation, or make a distinctive sound when starting up to indicate their unique status.\n",

This wave eats up other projectiles it meets, and if it hits the opponent on the ground, will cause them to stagger (on air hit they just get floated a bit, but the untech time is still decent). This instant flick also makes Potemkin recovery significantly faster, allowing him to capitalize on this new pressure he's created.\n\nFor a list of all projectiles Potemkin can flick, please see shorturl.at/amxU6\n",

This wave of energy absorbs other projectiles that hit it, and if it hits the opponent it staggers them (if grounded) or puts them in a slow float with long untechable time (if airborne). In both instances, Potemkin is afforded plenty of time to follow up for big damage. Since it's a projectile, he isn't pushed back by the attack connecting, allowing him to make some interesting combos in the corner. In addition, the energy wave has a very high stun modifier, making it easier to dizzy the opponent.\n\nFully invuln frames 1-9.\n",

Holographic alerts fill the air around Potemkin as he bends forward, extending his body mechanically before rapidly launching himself forward. Does massive damage and blows the opponent away on hit with substantial untechable time. Unlike Giganter itself, however, it has a 0x stun modifier, so its damage isn't counted at all when determining dizzy state for the opponent. This makes the choice to use Blid an interesting one: do you go for the upfront damage and potential follow-up damage, or go for the dizzy and reset into an even more damaging combo?\n\nThe core factor for deciding which to use is your opponent's current healthbar - the more health they have, the more you'll want to favor going for dizzy. Positioning matters as well, since Blid only offers the opportunity to follow up if you're in or very near the corner.\n",

Staggers on counterhit.\n\n2S does a clockwise spin with the sword. Slow to start up but has a big hitbox and causes ground bounce on hit. Requires S sword to already be placed with 6S.\n\n6H does a downward vertical slash with the H sword. Appears above opponents. Staggers on counterhit.\n\n2H is similar to 2S but instead does a counter-clockwise spin. Difficult to avoid and also causes the most blockstun out of all the other sword attacks due to its attack level. Floats on hit. Requires H sword to already be placed with 6H.\n\n\n\nUsing 6H or 6S causes one of the two familiars to do a tracking teleport to the opponent and attack once. The familiars will standby at the spot where they teleported initially until they are summoned again. She can cancel the majority of her normals into a summon as well as the second hit of combination attacks.\n\n",

If Raven does a glide, then hits with any air normal, then hits with j.H, the j.H will be cut short and Raven will snap to the ground, at which point he can use 2K or another low.  This \"glide snap\" happens consistently after the fourth overhead hit in a glide string, but it is not set in stone: doing something like j.K > delay j.H can snap Raven to the ground after 2 or 3 overhead hits.\n\nj.H will not snap Raven to the ground by itself. Doing glide hit > j.H will let Raven get all three hits of j.H - but Raven will be kept gliding for a moment after the move ends.  This can let an opponent begin to mash or throw early.\n\nj.H can also be used after a knockdown to safeglide characters with reversals such as Sol and Chipp.  In this case, simply do a normal ground combo into scratch, IAD glide, and input j.H early in the glide, so that only j.H(3) hits the opponent meaty.

This means that Raven can glide downward, cancel into an air normal, land before the air normal hits, and do a low like 2K.  These \"glide cancels\" are the core of Raven's mixup game.  For more details, see the strategy and combo sections.\n\nGliding at an opponent without the proper setup (knockdown, needle YRC, meaty orb) usually means eating a 6P, but Raven's j.K and air scratch (236S) let him beat anti-airs and condition his opponent to respect the glide.\n\nIn neutral, Raven can triangle jump (jump > glide > glide cancel > land) as a feint, which is very useful for encouraging your opponents to swing and then whiff punishing them. Jumping back and gliding can also be a good way to beat low or long recovery moves.\n",

Mostly ends blockstrings and combos because it knocks down on hit, allowing Raven enough time to IAD and meaty or start pressure with a glide string. RRC'ing ground scratch on block generates enough blockstun to jump forward and force a glide cancel mixup.  RRC'ing on hit lets Raven juggle into a glide combo; see the combo section for more details.\n\nThe aerial version has less startup, but also much less range. On counter hit, the aerial version can wallbounce, which allows for a follow-up with glide and/or anti-air command grab (63214S).  Raven can also start scratch loops off of a throw in the corner.\n\nAs of Rev2.1, aerial scratch will drop Raven to the ground quickly if he uses it after building speed in a glide (called a \"glide scratch\").  In the corner, he can combo freely at any excitement level.  Microdash 5K is a common starter; see the combo section for more details.\n",

This most commonly happens when comboing from Raven's command grab or glide scratch, but low altitude air-to-air combos can also set up a j.D.  In the corner, juggling into ground scratch (236S) also usually give Raven enough time to do TK air orb and have it hit meaty.\n\nOrb also has use in corner combos: see the combo section for more details.\n\nIn neutral, orb can be used to prevent an approach from the ground or air, but its long startup makes this a bit risky.\n",

Against some characters with light weights or weird hurtboxes, Raven can have trouble ending his corner combos in knockdowns: dash super can be an expensive but stable alternative to those combos.\n\nIf Raven has 100 meter, he can do dash super > OTG stab super as a guts crush option. He can also RRC into anti-air command grab for a combo and 8 ticks of excitement, although spending that much meter and not killing is a steep price.\n",

This is used in several different cross up mixups where you would be able to combo into j.214S or even 2H.\n\nSurprisingly annoying to antiair with some characters when done at certain heights, although you will be forced to chain into j.D before you land to avoid being thrown upon landing if they were to just block it, or on normal hit if not done low enough to the ground, which would be the height you usually should have gotten antiaired anyway if your opponent has solid antiair options. The chain into j.D can be difficult for players to deal with as you can choose which hit of j.H to cancel into j.D (although opponents can always just upback it). Can be difficult to convert into a combo when used in this fashion however, as you need to commit heavily into j.214S on the first hit of j.H, which also only combos on CH.\n\nYou can also convert into a combo with 2P, 2K, and even 5P (forced standing on hit) if done from the right height.\n",

Ground bounces on counter hit, which is easier to convert off of on the way down as opposed to on the way up from a jump. Can also be used to bait throws during leap oki by doing it right before you land, which also is plus on block if you do it at a very low height.\n\nThis is also one of Sin's only ways of getting guaranteed knockdowns midscreen from air combos meterlessly in Rev 2. j.D won't provide strong oki as you will land fairly close to them with no time to eat afterwards, but the option is there.\n\nOddly, j.D can be jump cancelled on block or hit, although you won't get to use it very often, except for certain j.D knockdown setups.\n",

Not every character have easy access to these however, so they have to resort to hard baiting it, unless Sin is low on calories, or has no meter.\n\nThis move is a staple for many of Sin's combos as it is useful when cancelled with 236H, 236K, or even leap.

On top of that, if blocked, Sin still has to ability to special cancel. This move used to be extremely low committal, but with an added 8 frames of recovery, whiffing it either by misplacing it or by a well timed jump by the opponent is no longer an alright situation.\n\nNote that each hit of Beak Driver have slightly different properties.\n\nThe 1st hit is much shorter in range and not very active. The hitbox is pretty much centered on Sin while it is active. It also is relatively easy to low profile, as it doesn't actually hit a lot of characters when they crouch. The first hit also has projectile cancelling properties. The 2nd hit, which comes out on frame 14, is much further in reach and more active. The hitbox of the 2nd hit gradually gets harder to low profile towards the tip. Although it doesn't cancel projectiles, most projectiles disappear on hit so it still deals with most projectiles well. Finally, on CH, this hit wallbounces the enemy which allows Sin to convert into a full combo with his leaps. \n\nIf the 2nd hit CHs, you can buffer 214 as Beak hits to confirm P/K on reaction to leap. With 50 meter, the most optimal combo is for him to RRC and then dash 6H > Hawk Baker > ... . Closer up on normal hit, it can convert into a knockdown with Elk Hunt, but if further out, the only option is to continue the combo with is 236H~HHHHH. The uncharged version is also the standard combo ender as it gives knockdown which allows Sin to eat safely, or leap in for oki after.\n\nSin also has the ability to charge the move, which can delay the startup of beak, potentially ruining timings of your opponent's approach/whiff punish attempts. After a certain amount of time Beak Driver is held, it becomes the charged version upon release, massively increasing the hitbox of the 2nd hit and making it extremely difficult to low profile, if not impossible. This version also has massive blockstun (more than lvl 4 attacks), making it hard to punish if you eat after. Despite the recovery frame change to the uncharged version in 1.03, the charged version still maintains the same recovery frames it had before, retaining its +4 on block while being hard to punish on whiff. On top of that, it does more damage and wallsticks in the corner, which allows Sin access to his more damaging combos. It even can loop into itself (usually up to 2~3 times, but more is possible with microdashes) if you manage to get them at the right height to trigger the wall slump state.\n\nGenerally, you don't get to convert off of charged beak hits unless they wallsplat, but you do get to eat afterwards, at least twice while keeping yourself safe. However, the 2nd hit still does wallbounce on CH, so the same conversions you get off of Beak Driver 2nd hit CH is still possible.\n\nThe air version is used in corner for wall bounce loops after j.D > j.214S starter. Deals slightly more damage than grounded variant. Used in some midscreen combos by cancelling into during the rise of Leap. No longer knockdowns but still knocks them away. Corner crossups from this move's ability to pull them out of the corner are available if you're creative. Can also poke enemies out of the sky from a reasonable distance in which most moves would not. TK'ing can be used to catch jump outs from pressure. Cannot be charged.\n\nEnding corner combos in low height air break drivers, either through TKs or earliest air beak out of leaps leaves a small enough gap in the corner for you to cross them up.\n",

Going into this from 236H doesn't have the extra cost of canceling a special into a special, and ends up costing 6,000 calories. Up to 13 hits, not counting the first two from Beak Driver. Use this to burn through opponents' guts when their hp is low and you have the calories.\n\nThis move also tends to give your opponent a ton of meter on hit during combos while building their burst meter back quickly, although it is the most damaging combo ender you can do from a lot of normals at max range.\n",

In the corner, is useful when chained into 623S for corner confirms off of 623S's critical hit.  \n\nA strange property of Elk Hunt is that it has variable start up and travel distance, which changes depending on how close Sin is to an opponent during start up. What happens is that Sin accelerates until he comes within a certain proximity of the opponent. Once he is close enough, only then the active frames come in.\n\nThis is why Sin is practically always +0 on normal block as it rarely, if not, never ever hits meaty from distance alone, unless if done from full screen. It is also why f. S/2S>Elk Hunt is very distance dependent to combo. The distance you end up with after an opponent blocks Elk also can change subtly depending on how far away you were before it hits.\n\nThe mixture of its variable startup is also why it tends to lose to other lows and slides rather easily from a distance, even if you started Elk Hunt very early, as Elk Hunt can go up to 21 frames in start up if done from max range. This property can also make it lackluster at chasing backdashes.\n\nAlso be careful of opponents catching onto you doing it too often in neutral even though it is safe on block, as preemptive neutral jumping can translate into a punish. Getting Elk Hunt IB'd forces you on the defensive as well or force you to spend even more calories to keep yourself safe/frame trap which may not pay off.\n",

However, 5K's speed requires the opponent to use these moves preemptively to punish it. Moves like Sol's 6P will win but are also riskier to whiff than Slayer's 5K.\n\nYou could say that Slayer's plan in every matchup is to stay in 5K range. 5K works well with 2H, 6H, 6P, and Dandy Step since opponents will be tempted to escape Slayer's pressure once he leaves 5K range. Repeated use of 5K creates space between Slayer and his opponent, which can make 2H, 6H, 6P, and Dandy Step difficult to punish.\n\nGatling Options: 6P, 6H, 5D, 2D\n\nA good frame trap with a 4-7F gap.

As of Patch 1.04 Slayer's 6K is +5 on most of the cast when they are crouching, allowing him to link a c.S or a 2P.

Despite this, opponents may be caught off guard by the High and 30 damage adds up.\n\n6K is slow enough that mashing can beat it in neutral. If your opponent is aware enough to use OS Throw or has a fast 5H/6H, it becomes difficult to use 6K outside of oki. Some Lows will even beat 6K, so do not be surprised if you cannot earn Counter Hits this way.\n\nOn oki, you can time a meaty 6K for more frame advantage, it will also be safe against most backdashes. However, using 6K this early also makes it more obvious for the opponent to reversal.\n\n6K feint, written as 6[K], is mainly used to set up a Throw since the opponent will not be put into blockstun. It can also bait opponents trying to Instant Block, Blitz Shield, or Dead Angle. Once the opponent expects a Throw after 6[K] and tries to react with their own Throw, you can start using BDC.\n",

Puts the opponent in a stagger state, which is mashable, but leaves Slayer in an advantageous position where he can try several different followups - 6H, 2H, IAD, another bite, etc. He also gains a temporary buff to his special moves, making the situation more dangerous.\n\nDash bite (6632147H) greatly increases the threat range for this move and is an important part of Slayer's offense. The input is well worth practicing.\n\nBDC Bite (6321447H) is more difficult to do but is a powerful defensive tool. If done perfectly (hit 7H within 1 frame of the dash) it is strike invulnerable all the way until it grabs i.e. a true reversal - but a slightly imperfect BDC Bite will get the job done in most situations also. Used most often on wakeup or after a K Mappa Hunch where the characters recover at the same time and opponent is likely to try to jab you.\n",

It can be used as an invulnerable reversal, but is slower than Ground H Volcanic Viper (HSVV or HVV) and has a much thinner hitbox. It is not as unsafe as HVV, but still easily punishable.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n\nAerial S Volcanic Viper (j.SVV) can be used as an anti-anti-air, which becomes particularly strong with Roman Cancel available. Note that its hurtbox reaches much lower than that of Aerial H Volcanic Viper (j.HVV). It can also be used to counter aerial attacks at close range. j.SVV is used frequently to end air combos with knockdown. A close to ground j.SVV can link into 5P upon landing, making Tiger Knee j.SVV useful in certain mid-screen confirms.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n\nGround H Volcanic Viper (HSVV or HVV) is Sol\u2019s strongest defensive tool, and has applications for neutral and offense as well. It has fast start-up and is invulnerable instantly, so it can be used on wake-up or at any gap in the opponent\u2019s pressure to counter their attacks. HVV is highly unsafe on block or whiff. Having Roman Cancel (RC) available removes much of the risk associated with it, allowing combos on hit or pressure if it is blocked. If the second hit connects on Counter Hit, it can be followed up with a combo at no Tension cost. HVV is a strong anti-air option that can only fail if the opponent uses Faultless Defense or dodges it somehow. It is particularly useful for punishing forward air dashes, since the opponent must wait until the air dash is complete to Faultless Defense. On offense, HVV can be used as a frame trap and anti-throw option.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n\nLike Aerial S Volcanic Viper (j.SVV), Aerial H Volcanic Viper (j.HVV) can counter aerial attacks, and can be used to end air combos with knockdown. j.HVV reaches much higher than its S counterpart, so it can be used from farther away. While j.HVV has higher base damage than j.SVV, you need to be closer to land both hits, so which version you go for in combos will ultimately depend on positioning.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n",

Dealing a total of 10 hits, connecting with either version results in a large amount of damage, especially if it hits raw. With all 9 rising hits building a base 7.2% Tension on hit, (DI) HVV has the highest Tension Gain of any attack in the game. A successful (DI) HVV almost always builds enough Tension to pay for a Roman Cancel (RC), at which point Sol can convert the already powerful attack into a full combo. (DI) j.HVV also has the bonus of requiring Faultless Defense to block after the first hit, a property not shared by regular j.HVV. Of course, the move is not without its weaknesses. Both versions are massively unsafe on block or whiff, putting Sol at a greater disadvantage than any other attack he has. For that reason, you should never go for a (DI) HVV in unconfirmable situations without the necessary 50% Tension required to RC. With an RC available, however, there is another interesting use for (DI) HVV. The first hit alone deals 60 damage, launches, is completely untechable and only decreases the R.I.S.C. Level by one, making it perhaps the most dangerous single hit in the game. RCing the first hit and continuing with a combo can result in massive damage, especially off a 7 frame attack with invulnerable start-up.\n"

(DI) BR does not work very well as a pressure tool at close range on grounded opponents, however, as Sol moves so far forward that crouching will usually force the last hit to whiff over the opponent, leaving Sol wide open. Because of this, it is best used either at a distance or in expectation of a jump. As the last hit of the ground version is an overhead, it\u2019s not uncommon to use it to reset pressure at a distance where only the last hit will connect, provided that the opponent is too scared to press a button. Because of its significant untechable time, (DI) BR can also be used as a combo tool near the corner, particularly on air hit. It can even be looped several times in the corner, although the damage isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n\nIn the air, (DI) BR functions like its regular counterpart, but the increased attack level and decreased landing recovery means that it can also be used as a combo part on air hit.\n",

Firstly, start-up becomes noticably faster, further enhancing its viability in neutral situations. While Sol does not hang in the air for as long to bait out anti-air attempts, the speed of the move and the danger of DI in general make it risky to challenge. Secondly, the flame that normally appears upon hitting the ground is replaced by a large explosion, granting Sol even greater advantage without the possibility of the second hit whiffing at point-blank. The explosion even hits behind Sol, creating potential cross-ups, although the minimum height requirement usually restricts this function to okizeme or other situations in which Sol is able to get high above the opponent. On hit, the explosion launches the opponent high and far, sporting a massive amount of untechable time. This allows Sol to easily follow-up with the jumping normal of his choice (including after an Instant Air Dash), or even (DI) Bandit Bringer during low untechable time decay. Because of this, (DI) Break is a very versatile combo part during DI combos, both mid-screen for corner carry and in the corner for j.D > (DI) Break loops. That being said, using it in combos limits your maximum damage considerably, so if you can avoid using it in that context, do so.\n",

It boasts a start-up of only 4 frames, and can outrange normal throws. It allows strong Tension-free follow-up combos. During pressure, WT is used most effectively in conjunction with frame traps and lows, with the outcome depending on whether opponents opt to try either countering its start-up or jumping and backdashing to avoid it. Opponents using Faultless Defense excessively to keep Sol out are extra susceptible to WT. It is important to space WT well, because it can be thrown out of start-up if done too close. On whiff, there is a recovery animation which can be easily punished, but it can be Purple Roman Cancelled for safety.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n\nWhile Sol is in Dragon Install, WT functions in exactly the same way as normal.

RS recovers quickly upon connecting and Sol is able to act shortly after reaching the apex of his ascent from the second hit, allowing for follow-up combos on hit and safety on block. At mid-screen, RS is punishable on reaction by 6P, invulnerable attacks, Blitz Shield, or otherwise, so it is dangerous to use frequently. With Sol\u2019s back to the corner, it becomes much more practical, since Sol has less distance to travel backwards. Using Yellow Roman Cancel during the backwards travel of RS is a useful method of quickly distancing yourself from the opponent.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n\nIn Dragon Install (DI), the first two hits of Riot Stamp are entirely unchanged outside of Tension Gain. For this reason, its use in neutral is almost entirely restricted to the exact same situations as the regular version and therefore should be used sparingly. However, should a (DI) Riot Stamp get as far as that second hit, the situation quickly changes. After Sol kicks down, an inferno rises from underneath the opponent. This inferno has a ludicrous amount of active frames, and as Sol himself recovers at the same time he would for the regular version, his advantage on block goes from high to frankly absurd. Similarly, on hit, Sol gets a lot more freedom to do as he pleases.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n",

Grand Viper (GV) is the most risky attack in Sol\u2019s arsenal, it has massive recovery and cannot be cancelled on whiff. \n\nThe player must rapidly press directions and buttons (not including D) to achieve the maximum travel distance and 9 hits. GV will reach the opponent quickly from nearly full screen, so it is useful for catching opponents out of anything they might be doing from far away. It can low profile any attack that does not reach the floor, which can be useful at neutral, on wake-up, or while being pressured. Mid-screen ground hits confirmed into GV will lead to high damage combos with great corner carry.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n\nIts faster start-up, movement speed and immediate super low profile state make it a very scary ranged low, a luxury not shared by many other moves. On block, (DI) GV cranks up the opponent\u2019s R.I.S.C. Level to a far greater degree than any other attack he has, basically guaranteeing that the opponent is forced into an automatic Counter Hit state if Sol gets the maximum number of hits. On hit, while Sol can opt to increase hits and therefore damage, there is an incentive to simply letting the attack perform its minimum number of hits. Due to the increased launch height on the final hit, if the hit count remains low, the opponent\u2019s gravity should remain at a state where Sol is able to follow-up with a sufficiently fast anti-air normal such as 5K or 2H and lead into an extended combo. (DI) GV also lacks several of the weaknesses of its regular counterpart. As Sol moves across the ground, he creates a set of high-reaching flame pillars behind him. This makes (DI) GV much harder to jump over. While these flame pillars can be blocked in any way, they do push the opponent back towards Sol, meaning that if a jumping opponent gets caught by a stray flame, they can potentially be pushed back into the rising section of the attack in spite of their attempts to clear it. Sol is able to Purple Roman Cancel to safety should he have the 50% Tension to spare. You can even choose to Yellow Roman Cancel the early portion of the attack if you don\u2019t want to commit to the full thing or simply wish to scare the opponent with a quick burst of forward movement.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n",

Sol\u2019s hurtbox lowers slightly during start-up, so it can duck under certain higher-hitting attacks and counter them. It recovers quickly, so if opponents avoided it by jumping, Sol often recovers fast enough to anti-air. It is useful in ranged pressure when opponents are conditioned not to attack. It must be blocked with Faultless Defense in air, so it can catch opponents at the beginning of their jump. On block, it is plus (unless Instant Blocked) and increases the opponent\u2019s R.I.S.C. Level considerably. Fafnir is used frequently in combos near corner. Its high base damage contributes to Sol's prominent stunning ability, especially from a Counter Hit Fafnir starter.

It also gives high damage combos from a corner 2D hit. It can be used as a more costly reversal option on wake-up or in pressure. However, Roman Canceling Volcanic Viper is almost always a better idea since it is much less risky. TR is slightly unsafe on block, whether the opponent interrupts the second hit or not. As a reversal, the only benefits TR has over VV are that it has more horizontal range and cannot be Bursted. Although when 75% Tension is available, TR has the added benefit of allowing Yellow Roman Cancel, so it can safely be cancelled when the opponent is ready to block it. It can also be used on offense similarly to VV as a frame trap, but this is rarely practical.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n\nThe Dragon Install (DI) version of Tyrant Rave ver.\u03b2 (TR) is a very scary Overdrive. The first hit is basically the same, albeit a couple of frames slower, but the scary part is what follows. The second hit is replaced by a travelling blast of fire, dealing 15 hits total and travelling from Sol's fist across the entire length of the screen. The raw damage on this attack is immense, especially during Hell Fire, and the increased strike invulnerability makes it not entirely terrible to just throw out. While Sol is at a disadvantage on block, the pushback from the blast forces the opponent to either Instant Block the first hit and punish before the second, or not at all. Where (DI) TR really shines though, is as a late combo part in the corner. The projectile causes wall stick near the corner, allowing for easy P.B.B. enders. Furthermore, if you delay (DI) TR so that the first hit connects right before the opponent hits the ground, they'll stick to the wall low enough to guarantee the slump afterwards. Because of this, many combos with (DI) TR can then be followed up with a grounded combo continuation into an ender.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n",

If used in neutral, Sol gains a great amount of initiative: He recovers instantly once the super freeze ends, and the combination of his speed advantage and his reward off any given hit is large enough that it becomes very risky for opponents to attempt to force the pace of the match into their favour. Of course, DI itself carries a large risk. When the mode\u2019s natural duration ends and Sol returns to neutral on the ground, he is forced into a lengthy recovery animation, making him incredibly vulnerable to a counter-offensive. Due to this, DI is only really recommended in situations where the recovery animation will not come into play, either to make a last minute comeback, to quickly finish off an opponent hanging on by a thread, or in a combo that can guarantee a safe exit out of DI. With proper timing, the invulnerability on DI allows it to be used after a knockdown as a big call-out against reversal attempts, especially those intending to Roman Cancel upon connecting. DI can also be used to create Burst-safe points in certain situations. Can be roman canceled just as the animation starts, only burns the meter for the cancel and cancels the transformation.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n",

As far as the attack start-up itself is concerned, Branding Breach is actually a fairly versatile IK. It has a lengthy amount of invulnerability and a decent hitbox, mainly thanks to the start-up animation being based on Fafnir. If conclusion conditions are met, it becomes possible to combo into Branding Breach off a Roman Cancelled Ground Throw or Wild Throw mid-screen, and any corner combo leading into a high air hit Fafnir can also combo into Branding Breach without requiring a Roman Cancel.\n\nSupplemental Frame Data:\n",

From close range sCR provides significant frame advantage which can be used as a pressure reset. sCR can also be used as a situational means to catch opponents who might otherwise low profile your other space control tools such as Stinger Aim and f.S. The further away sCR is used from, the easier it is for an opponent to avoid the hit and punish the user.\n\nExample situations where sCR can be useful:\n\n40 frame charge time\n\nH Carcass Raid is much more situational than S Carcass Raid. hCR's projectile disappears if Venom is hit while the projectile is active making it less safe than other options. hCR does have uses such as anti-airing enemies far above Venom, and hitting other balls. hCR is also able to give frame advantage when spaced properly.\n\nH Carcass Raid can be especially useful as a way to call out jump outs which would normally go over S Carcass Raid's projectile path.\n",
